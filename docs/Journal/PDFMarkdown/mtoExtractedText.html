<p>Multitenant organization capabilities in
Microsoft Entra ID
Article •04/23/2024
This article provides an overview of the multitenant organization scenario and the
related capabilities in Microsoft Entra ID.
A tenant  is an instance of Microsoft Entra ID in which information about a single
organization resides including organizational objects such as users, groups, and devices
and also application registrations, such as Microsoft 365 and third-party applications. A
tenant also contains access and compliance policies for resources, such as applications
registered in the directory. The primary functions served by a tenant include identity
authentication as well as resource access management.
From a Microsoft Entra perspective, a tenant forms an identity and access management
scope. For example, a tenant administrator makes an application available to some or all
the users in the tenant and enforces access policies on that application for users in that
tenant. In addition, a tenant contains organizational branding data that drives end-user
experiences, such as the organizations email domains and ShareP oint URLs used by
employees in that organization. From a Microsoft 365 perspective, a tenant forms the
default collaboration and licensing boundary. For example, users in Microsoft T eams or
Microsoft Outlook can easily find and collaborate with other users in their tenant, but
don&#39;t have the ability to find or see users in other tenants.
Tenants contain privileged organizational data and are securely isolated from other
tenants. In addition, tenants can be configured to have data persisted and processed in
a specific region or cloud, which enables organizations to use tenants as a mechanism
to meet data residency and handling compliance requirements.
A multit enant or ganization  is an organization that has more than one instance of
Microsoft Entra ID. Here are the primary reasons why an organization might have
multiple tenants:
Conglomerat es: Organizations with multiple subsidiaries or business units that
operate independently.What is a tenant?
What is a multitenant organization?</p>
<p>Mergers and acquisitions:  Organizations that merge or acquire companies.
Divestitur e activity:  In a divestiture, one organization splits off part of its business
to form a new organization or sell it to an existing organization.
Multiple clouds:  Organizations that have compliance or regulatory needs to exist
in multiple cloud environments.
Multiple geographical boundaries:  Organizations that operate in multiple
geographic locations with various residency regulations.
Test or staging t enants:  Organizations that need multiple tenants for testing or
staging purposes before deploying more broadly to primary tenants.
Department or employ ee-cr eated tenants:  Organizations where departments or
employees have created tenants for development, testing, or separate control.
Your organization may have recently acquired a new company, merged with another
company, or restructured based on newly formed business units. If you have disparate
identity management systems, it might be challenging for users in different tenants to
access resources and collaborate.
The following diagram shows how users in other tenants might not be able to access
applications across tenants in your organization.
As your organization evolves, your IT team must adapt to meet the changing needs. This
often includes integrating with an existing tenant or forming a new one. R egardless of
how the identity infrastructure is managed, it&#39;s critical that users have a seamless
experience accessing resources and collaborating. T oday, you may be using custom
scripts or on-premises solutions to bring the tenants together to provide a seamless
experience across tenants.
To enable users across tenants to collaborate in Teams Connect shared channels , you
can use Microsoft Entra B2B direct connect . B2B direct connect is a feature of External
Identities that lets you set up a mutual trust relationship with another Microsoft Entra
organization for seamless collaboration in T eams. When the trust is established, the B2B
direct connect user has single sign-on access using credentials from their home tenant.Multitenant challenges

B2B direct connect</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the primary constraint with using B2B direct connect across multiple tenants:
Currently, B2B direct connect works only with T eams Connect shared channels.
For more information, see B2B direct connect overview .
To enable users across tenants to collaborate, you can use Microsoft Entra B2B
collaboration . B2B collaboration is a feature within External Identities that lets you invite
guest users to collaborate with your organization. Once the external user has redeemed
their invitation or completed sign-up, they&#39;re represented in your tenant as a user
object. With B2B collaboration, you can securely share your company&#39;s applications and
services with external users, while maintaining control over your own corporate data.
Here are the primary constraints with using B2B collaboration across multiple tenants:
Administrators must invite users using the B2B invitation process or build an
onboarding experience using the B2B collaboration invitation manager .
Administrators might have to synchronize users using custom scripts.
Depending on automatic redemption settings, users might need to accept a
consent prompt and follow a redemption process in each tenant.
By default, users are of type external guest, which has different permissions than
external member and might not be the desired user experience.

B2B collaboration
</p>
<p>For more information, see B2B collaboration overview .
If you want users to have a more seamless collaboration experience across tenants, you
can use cross-tenant synchronization . Cross-tenant synchronization is a one-way
synchronization service in Microsoft Entra ID that automates creating, updating, and
deleting B2B collaboration users across tenants in an organization. Cross-tenant
synchronization builds on the B2B collaboration functionality and utilizes existing B2B
cross-tenant access settings. Users are represented in the target tenant as a B2B
collaboration user object.
Here are the primary benefits with using cross-tenant synchronization:
Automatically create B2B collaboration users within your organization and provide
them access to the applications they need, without creating and maintaining
custom scripts.
Improve the user experience and ensure that users can access resources, without
receiving an invitation email and having to accept a consent prompt in each
tenant.
Automatically update users and remove them when they leave the organization.
Here are the primary constraints with using cross-tenant synchronization across multiple
tenants:
Doesn&#39;t enhance the current T eams or Microsoft 365 experiences. S ynchronized
users will have the same cross-tenant T eams and Microsoft 365 experiences
available to any other B2B collaboration user.
Doesn&#39;t synchronize groups, devices, or contacts.
For more information, see What is cross-tenant synchronization? .Cross-tenant synchronization
</p>
<p>Multitenant organization  is a feature in Microsoft Entra ID and Microsoft 365 that
enables you to form a tenant group within your organization. Each pair of tenants in the
group is governed by cross-tenant access settings that you can use to configure B2B or
cross-tenant synchronization.
Here are the primary benefits of a multitenant organization:
Differentiate in-organization and out-of-organization external users
Improved collaborative experience in new Microsoft T eams
Improved people search experience across tenants
For more information, see What is a multitenant organization in Microsoft Entra ID? .
Depending on the needs of your organization, you can use any combination of B2B
direct connect, B2B collaboration, cross-tenant synchronization, and multitenant
organization capabilities. B2B direct connect and B2B collaboration are independent
capabilities, while cross-tenant synchronization and multitenant organization capabilities
are independent of each other, though both rely on underlying B2B collaboration.
The following table compares the capabilities of each feature. For more information
about different external identity scenarios, see Comparing External Identities feature

Multitenant organization is a feature in Microsoft Entra ID and Microsoft 365 that
enables you to form a tenant group within your organization. Each pair of tenants in the
group is governed by cross-tenant access settings that you can use to configure B2B or
cross-tenant synchronization.
Here are the primary goals of multitenant organization:
Define a group of tenants belonging to your organization
Collaborate across your tenants in new Microsoft T eams
Enable search and discovery of user profiles across your tenants through Microsoft
365 people search
Organizations that own multiple Microsoft Entra tenants and want to streamline intra-
organization cross-tenant collaboration in Microsoft 365.
The multitenant organization capability is built on the assumption of reciprocal
provisioning of B2B member users across multitenant organization tenants.
As such, the multitenant organization capability assumes the simultaneous use of
Microsoft Entra cross-tenant synchronization or an alternative bulk provisioning engine
for external identities .
Here are the primary benefits of a multitenant organization:
Differentiate in-organization and out-of-organization external users
In Microsoft Entra ID, external users originating from within a multitenant
organization can be differentiated from external users originating from outside the
multitenant organization. This differentiation facilitates the application of different
policies for in-organization and out-of-organization external users.Why use multitenant organization?
Who should use it?
Benefits</p>
<p>Improved collaborative experience in Microsoft T eams
In new Microsoft T eams, multitenant organization users can expect an improved
collaborative experience across tenants with chat, calling, and meeting start
notifications from all connected tenants across the multitenant organization.
Tenant switching is more seamless and faster. For more information, see
Announcing more seamless collaboration in Microsoft T eams for multitenant
organizations  and Microsoft T eams: Advantages of the new architecture .
Improved people search experience across tenants
Across Microsoft 365 services, the multitenant organization people search
experience is a collaboration feature that enables search and discovery of people
across multiple tenants. Once enabled, users are able to search and discover
synced user profiles in a tenant&#39;s global address list and view their corresponding
people cards. For more information, see Microsoft 365 multitenant organization
people search .
The multitenant organization capability enables you to form a tenant group within your
organization. The following list describes the basic lifecycle of a multitenant
organization.
Define a multitenant organization
One tenant administrator defines a multitenant organization as a grouping of
tenants. The grouping of tenants isn&#39;t reciprocal until each listed tenant takes
action to join the multitenant organization. The objective is a reciprocal agreement
between all listed tenants.
Join a multitenant organization
Tenant administrators of listed tenants take action to join the multitenant
organization. After joining, the multitenant organization relationship is reciprocal
between each and every tenant that joined the multitenant organization.
Leave a multitenant organization
Tenant administrators of listed tenants can leave a multitenant organization at any
time. While a tenant administrator who defined the multitenant organization can
add and remove listed tenants they don&#39;t control the other tenants.
How does a multitenant organization work?</p>
<p>A multitenant organization is established as a collaboration of equals. Each tenant
administrator stays in control of their tenant and their membership in the multitenant
organization.
Administrators staying in control of their resources is a guiding principle for multitenant
organization collaboration. Cross-tenant access settings are required for each tenant-to-
tenant relationship. T enant administrators explicitly configure, as needed, the following
policies:
Cross-tenant access partner configurations
For more information, see Configure cross-tenant access settings for B2B
collaboration  and crossT enantAccessP olicyConfigurationP artner resource type .
Cross-tenant access identity synchronization
For more information, see Configure cross-tenant synchronization  and
crossT enantIdentityS yncPolicyP artner resource type .

organization.Cross-tenant access setting s

B Administrators see a multitenant organization consisting of A, B, C.
They also see cross-tenant access settings for A and C.
C Administrators see a multitenant organization consisting of A, B, C.
They also see cross-tenant access settings for A and B.
To ease the setup of homogenous cross-tenant access settings applied to partner
tenants in the multitenant organization, the administrator of each multitenant
organization tenant can configure optional cross-tenant access settings templates
dedicated to the multitenant organization. These templates can be used to preconfigure
cross-tenant access settings that are applied to any partner tenant newly joining the
multitenant organization.
To facilitate the management of a multitenant organization, any given multitenant
organization tenant has an associated role and state.
Tenant
roleDescr iption
Owner One tenant creates the multitenant organization. The multitenant organization
creating tenant receives the role of owner. The privilege of the owner tenant is to add
tenants into a pending state as well as to remove tenants from the multitenant
organization. Also, an owner tenant can change the role of other multitenant
organization tenants.
Member Following the addition of pending tenants to the multitenant organization, pending
tenants need to join the multitenant organization to turn their state from pending to
active. Joined tenants typically start in the member role. Any member tenant has the
privilege to leave the multitenant organization.Templates for cross-tenant access setting s
Tenant role and state
ﾉExpand table
ﾉExpand table</p>
<p>Tenant
stateDescr iption
Pending A pending tenant has yet to join a multitenant organization. While listed in an
administrator’s view of the multitenant organization, a pending tenant isn&#39;t yet part of
the multitenant organization, and as such is hidden from an end user’s view of a
multitenant organization.
Active Following the addition of pending tenants to the multitenant organization, pending
tenants need to join the multitenant organization to turn their state from pending to
active. Joined tenants typically start in the member role. Any member tenant has the
privilege to leave the multitenant organization.
The multitenant organization capability has been designed with the following
constraints:
Any given tenant can only create or join a single multitenant organization.
Any multitenant organization must have at least one active owner tenant.
Each active tenant must have cross-tenant access settings for all active tenants.
Any active tenant may leave a multitenant organization by removing themselves
from it.
A multitenant organization is deleted when the only remaining active (owner)
tenant leaves.
Resour ce Limit Notes
Maximum
number of
active tenants,
including the
owner tenant100 The owner tenant can add more than 100 pending tenants, but they
won&#39;t be able to join the multitenant organization if the limit is
exceeded. This limit is applied at the time a pending tenant joins a
multitenant organization. This limit is specific to the number of tenants
in a multitenant organization. It does not apply to cross-tenant
synchronization by itself. T o increase this limit, submit a support
request in the Microsoft Entra or Microsoft 365 admin center.
In the Microsoft Graph APIs, the default limit of 100 tenants is only
enforced at the time of joining. In Microsoft 365 admin center, the
default limit is enforced at multitenant organization creation time and
at time of joining.Constraints
Limits
ﾉExpand table</p>
<p>By defining a multitenant organization, as well as pivoting on the Microsoft Entra user
property of userT ype, external identities  are segmented as follows:
External members originating from within a multitenant organization
External guests originating from within a multitenant organization
External members originating from outside of your organization
External guests originating from outside of your organization
This segmentation of external users, due to the definition of a multitenant organization,
enables administrators to better differentiate in-organization from out-of-organization
external users.
External members originating from within a multitenant organization are called
multitenant organization members.
Multitenant collaboration capabilities in Microsoft 365 aim to provide a seamless
collaboration experience across tenant boundaries when collaborating with multitenant
organization member users.
If you haven&#39;t previously used Microsoft Entra cross-tenant synchronization, and
you intend to establish a collaborating user set  topology where the same set of
users is shared to all multitenant organization tenants, you might want to use the
Microsoft 365 admin center share users functionality.
If you&#39;re already using Microsoft Entra cross-tenant synchronization, for various
multi-hub multi-spoke topologies , you don&#39;t need to use the Microsoft 365 admin
center share users functionality. Instead, you might want to continue using your
existing Microsoft Entra cross-tenant synchronization jobs.
Here are the basic steps to get started using multitenant organization.
For more information, see Plan for multitenant organizations in Microsoft 365 .External user segmentation
Choosing between Microsoft 365 admin center
and cross-tenant synchronization
Get started
Step 1: Plan your deployment</p>
<p>Create your multitenant organization using Microsoft 365 admin center , Microsoft
Graph P owerShell , or Microsoft Graph API :
First tenant, soon-to-be owner tenant, creates a multitenant organization.
Owner tenant adds one or more joiner tenants.
Join a multitenant organization using Microsoft 365 admin center  or Microsoft Graph
PowerShell , or Microsoft Graph API :
Joiner tenants submit a join request to join the multitenant organization of owner
tenant.
To allow for asynchronous processing, wait up to 2 hour s.
Your multitenant organization is formed.
Depending on your use case, you may want to synchronize users using one of the
following methods:
Synchronize users in multitenant organizations in Microsoft 365
Configure cross-tenant synchronization
Configure cross-tenant synchronization using P owerShell or Microsoft Graph API
Your alternative bulk provisioning engine
The multitenant organization capability requires Microsoft Entra ID P1 licenses. Only one
Microsoft Entra ID P1 license is required per employee per multitenant organization.
Also, you must have at least one Microsoft Entra ID P1 license per tenant. T o find the
right license for your requirements, see Compare generally available features of
Microsoft Entra ID .

Article •01/03/2024
Cross-tenant s ynchr onization  automates creating, updating, and deleting Microsoft Entra
B2B collaboration  users across tenants in an organization. It enables users to access
applications and collaborate across tenants, while still allowing the organization to
evolve.
Here are the primary goals of cross-tenant synchronization:
Seamless collaboration for a multitenant organization
Automate lifecycle management of B2B collaboration users in a multitenant
organization
Automatically remove B2B accounts when a user leaves the organization
Cross-tenant synchronization automates creating, updating, and deleting B2B
collaboration users. Users created with cross-tenant synchronization are able to access
both Microsoft applications (such as T eams and ShareP oint) and non-Microsoft
applications (such as ServiceNow , Adobe , and many more), regardless of which tenant
the apps are integrated with. These users continue to benefit from the security
capabilities in Microsoft Entra ID, such as Microsoft Entra Conditional Access  and cross-
tenant access settings , and can be governed through features such as Microsoft Entra
entitlement management .
The following diagram shows how you can use cross-tenant synchronization to enable
users to access applications across tenants in your organization.<a href="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7B-PQwNfGBc">https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7B-PQwNfGBc</a>
Why use cross-tenant synchronization?</p>
<p>Organizations that own multiple Microsoft Entra tenants and want to streamline
intra-organization cross-tenant application access.
Cross-tenant synchronization is not currently suitable for use across organizational
boundaries.
With cross-tenant synchronization, you can do the following:
Automatically create B2B collaboration users within your organization and provide

Automatically update users and remove them when they leave the organization.
Users created by cross-tenant synchronization will have the same experience when
accessing Microsoft T eams and other Microsoft 365 services as B2B collaboration users
created through a manual invitation. If your organization uses shared channels, please
see the known issues  document for additional details. Over time, the member userT ype

<p>When you configure cross-tenant synchronization, you define a trust relationship
between a source tenant and a target tenant. Cross-tenant synchronization has the
following properties:
Based on the Microsoft Entra provisioning engine.
Is a push process from the source tenant, not a pull process from the target tenant.
Supports pushing only internal members from the source tenant. It doesn&#39;t
support syncing external users from the source tenant.
Users in scope for synchronization are configured in the source tenant.
Attribute mapping is configured in the source tenant.
Extension attributes are supported.
Target tenant administrators can stop a synchronization at any time.

Here are the basic steps to get started using cross-tenant synchronization.ﾉExpand table
How do users know what tenants they belong to?
Get started</p>
<p>Cross-tenant synchronization provides a flexible solution to enable collaboration, but
every organization is different. For example, you might have a central tenant, satellite
tenants, or sort of a mesh of tenants. Cross-tenant synchronization supports any of
these topologies. For more information, see Topologies for cross-tenant
synchronization .
In the target tenant where users are created, navigate to the Cross-t enant access
settings  page. Here you enable cross-tenant synchronization and the B2B automatic
redemption settings by selecting the respective check boxes. For more information, see
Configure cross-tenant synchronization .
In any source tenant, navigate to the Cross-t enant access settings  page and enable the
B2B automatic redemption feature. Next, you use the Cross-t enant synchr onization
page to set up a cross-tenant synchronization job and specify:
Which users you want to synchronize
What attributes you want to include
Any transformations
For anyone that has used Microsoft Entra ID to provision identities into a SaaS
application , this experience will be familiar. Once you have synchronization configured,Step 1: Define how to structure the tenants in your organization
Step 2: Enable cross-tenant synchronization in the target tenants
Step 3: Enable cross-tenant synchronization in the source tenants</p>
<p>you can start testing with a few users and make sure they&#39;re created with all the
attributes that you need. When testing is complete, you can quickly add additional users
to synchronize and roll out across your organization. For more information, see
Configure cross-tenant synchronization .
In the source tenant: Using this feature requires Microsoft Entra ID P1 licenses. Each user
who is synchronized with cross-tenant synchronization must have a P1 license in their
home/source tenant. T o find the right license for your requirements, see Compare
generally available features of Microsoft Entra ID .
In the target tenant: Cross-tenant sync relies on the Microsoft Entra External ID billing
model. T o understand the external identities licensing model, see MAU billing model for
Microsoft Entra External ID . You will also need at least one Microsoft Entra ID P1 license
in the target tenant to enable auto-redemption.
Which clouds can cross-tenant synchronization be used in?
Cross-tenant synchronization is supported within the commercial cloud and Azure
Government.
Cross-tenant synchronization isn&#39;t supported within the Microsoft Azure operated
by 21Vianet cloud.
Synchronization is only supported between two tenants in the same cloud.
Cross-cloud (such as public cloud to Azure Government) isn&#39;t currently supported.
Will cross-tenant synchronization manage existing B2B users?License requirements
Frequently asked questions
Clouds
Existing B2B users</p>
<p>Yes. Cross-tenant synchronization uses an internal attribute called the
alternativeSecurityIdentifier to uniquely match an internal user in the source tenant
with an external / B2B user in the target tenant. Cross-tenant synchronization can
update existing B2B users, ensuring that each user has only one account.
Cross-tenant synchronization cannot match an internal user in the source tenant
with an internal user in the target tenant (both type member and type guest).
How often does cross-tenant synchronization run?
The sync interval is currently fixed to start at 40-minute intervals. S ync duration
varies based on the number of in-scope users. The initial sync cycle is likely to take
significantly longer than the following incremental sync cycles.
How do I control what is synchronized into the target tenant?
In the source tenant, you can control which users are provisioned with the
configuration or attribute-based filters. Y ou can also control what attributes on the
user object are synchronized. For more information, see Scoping users or groups
to be provisioned with scoping filters .
If a user is removed from the scope of sync in a source tenant, will cross-tenant
synchronization soft delete them in the target?
Yes. If a user is removed from the scope of sync in a source tenant, cross-tenant
synchronization will soft delete them in the target tenant.
What object types can be synchronized?
Microsoft Entra users can be synchronized between tenants. (Groups, devices, and
contacts aren&#39;t currently supported.)
What user types can be synchronized?
Internal members can be synchronized from source tenants. Internal guests can&#39;t
be synchronized from source tenants.
Users can be synchronized to target tenants as external members (default) or
external guests.Synchronization frequency
Scope
Object types</p>
<p>For more information about the UserT ype definitions, see Properties of a Microsoft
Entra B2B collaboration user .
I have existing B2B collaboration users. What will happen to them?
Cross-tenant synchronization will match the user and make any necessary updates
to the user, such as update the display name. By default, the UserT ype won&#39;t be
updated from guest to member, but you can configure this in the attribute
mappings.
What user attributes can be synchronized?
Cross-tenant synchronization will sync commonly used attributes on the user
object in Microsoft Entra ID, including (but not limited to) displayName,
userPrincipalName, and directory extension attributes.
Cross-tenant synchronization supports provisioning the manager attribute. Both
the user and their manager must be in scope for provisioning.
For cross-tenant synchronization configurations created before January 2024
with the default schema / attribute mappings:
The manager attribute will automatically be added to the mappings.
This does not trigger an initial sync cycle.
Manager updates will apply on the incremental cycle for users that are
undergoing changes (e.g. manager change). The sync engine doesn’t
automatically update all existing users that were provisioned previously.
To update the manager for existing users that are in scope for provisioning,
you can use on-demand provisioning for specific users or do a restart to
provision the manager for all users.
For cross-tenant synchronization configurations created before January 2024
with a custom schema / attribute mappings (e.g. you added an attribute to the
mappings or changed the default mappings):
You need to manually add the manager attribute to your attribute mappings.
This will trigger a restart and update all users that are in scope for
provisioning. This should be a direct mapping of the manager attribute in the
source tenant to the manager in the target tenant.
If the manager of a user is removed in the source tenant and no new manager is
assigned in the source tenant, the manager attribute will not be updated in the
target tenant.
What attributes can&#39;t be synchronized?Attributes</p>
<p>Attributes including (but not limited to) photos, custom security attributes, and
user attributes outside of the directory can&#39;t be synchronized by cross-tenant
synchronization.
Can I control where user attributes are sourced/managed?
Cross-tenant synchronization doesn&#39;t offer direct control over source of authority.
The user and its attributes are deemed authoritative at the source tenant. There are
parallel sources of authority workstreams that will evolve source of authority
controls for users down to the attribute level and a user object at the source may
ultimately reflect multiple underlying sources. For the tenant-to-tenant process,
this is still treated as the source tenant&#39;s values being authoritative for the sync
process (even if pieces actually originate elsewhere) into the target tenant.
Currently, there&#39;s no support for reversing the sync process&#39;s source of authority.
Cross-tenant synchronization only supports source of authority at the object level.
That means all attributes of a user must come from the same source, including
credentials. It isn&#39;t possible to reverse the source of authority or federation
direction of a synchronized object.
What happens if attributes for a synced user are changed in the target tenant?
Cross-tenant synchronization doesn&#39;t query for changes in the target. If no
changes are made to the synced user in the source tenant, then user attribute
changes made in the target tenant will persist. However, if changes are made to
the user in the source tenant, then during the next synchronization cycle, the user
in the target tenant will be updated to match the user in the source tenant.
Can the target tenant manually block sign-in for a specific home/source tenant user that
is synced?
If no changes are made to the synced user in the source tenant, then the block
sign-in setting in the target tenant will persist. If a change is detected for the user
in the source tenant, cross-tenant synchronization will re-enable that user blocked
from sign-in in the target tenant.
Can I sync a mesh between multiple tenants?
Cross-tenant synchronization is configured as a single-direction peer-to-peer sync,
meaning sync is configured between one source and one target tenant. Multiple
instances of cross-tenant synchronization can be configured to sync from a singleStructure</p>
<p>source to multiple targets and from multiple sources into a single target. But only
one sync instance can exist between a source and a target.
Cross-tenant synchronization only synchronizes users that are internal to the
home/source tenant, ensuring that you can&#39;t end up with a loop where a user is
written back to the same tenant.
Multiple topologies are supported. For more information, see Topologies for cross-
tenant synchronization .
Can I use cross-tenant synchronization across organizations (outside my multitenant
organization)?
For privacy reasons, cross-tenant synchronization is intended for use within an
organization. W e recommend using entitlement management  for inviting B2B
collaboration users across organizations.
Can cross-tenant synchronization be used to migrate users from one tenant to another
tenant?
No. Cross-tenant synchronization isn&#39;t a migration tool because the source tenant
is required for synchronized users to authenticate. In addition, tenant migrations
would require migrating user data such as ShareP oint and OneDrive.
Does cross-tenant synchronization resolve any present B2B collaboration  limitations?
Since cross-tenant synchronization is built on existing B2B collaboration
technology, existing limitations apply. Examples include (but aren&#39;t limited to):
App or
serviceLimitations
Power BI - Support for UserT ype Member in P ower BI is currently in preview. For

How does cross-tenant synchronization relate to B2B direct connect ?B2B collaboration
ﾉExpand table
B2B direct connect</p>
<p>B2B direct connect is the underlying identity technology required for Teams
Connect shared channels .
We recommend B2B collaboration for all other cross-tenant application access
scenarios, including both Microsoft and non-Microsoft applications.
B2B direct connect and cross-tenant synchronization are designed to co-exist, and
you can enable them both for broad coverage of cross-tenant scenarios.
We&#39;re trying to determine the extent to which we&#39;ll need to utilize cross-tenant
synchronization in our multitenant organization. Do you plan to extend support for B2B
direct connect beyond T eams Connect?
There&#39;s no plan to extend support for B2B direct connect beyond T eams Connect
shared channels.
Does cross-tenant synchronization enhance any cross-tenant Microsoft 365 app access
user experiences?
Cross-tenant synchronization utilizes a feature that improves the user experience
by suppressing the first-time B2B consent prompt and redemption process in each
tenant.
Synchronized users will have the same cross-tenant Microsoft 365 experiences
available to any other B2B collaboration user.
Can cross-tenant synchronization enable people search scenarios where synchronized
users appear in the global address list of the target tenant?
Yes, but you must set the value for the showInAddr essList  attribute of
synchronized users to True, which is not set by default. If you want to create a
unified address list, you&#39;ll need to set up a mesh peer-to-peer topology . For more
information, see Step 9: R eview attribute mappings .
Cross-tenant synchronization creates B2B collaboration users and doesn&#39;t create
contacts.
Does cross-tenant synchronization enhance any current T eams experiences?
Synchronized users will have the same cross-tenant Microsoft 365 experiences
available to any other B2B collaboration user.Microsoft 365
Teams</p>
<p>What federation options are supported for users in the target tenant back to the source
tenant?
For each internal user in the source tenant, cross-tenant synchronization creates a
federated external user (commonly used in B2B) in the target. It supports syncing
internal users. This includes internal users federated to other identity systems using
domain federation (such as Active Directory Federation Services ). It doesn&#39;t
support syncing external users.
Does cross-tenant synchronization use S ystem for Cross-Domain Identity Management
(SCIM)?
No. Currently, Microsoft Entra ID supports a SCIM client, but not a SCIM server. For
more information, see SCIM synchronization with Microsoft Entra ID .
Does cross-tenant synchronization support deprovisioning users?
Yes, when the below actions occur in the source tenant, the user will be soft
deleted  in the target tenant.
Delete the user in the source tenant
Unassign the user from the cross-tenant synchronization configuration
Remove the user from a group that is assigned to the cross-tenant
synchronization configuration
An attribute on the user changes such that they do not meet the scoping filter
conditions defined on the cross-tenant synchronization configuration anymore
If the user is blocked from sign-in in the source tenant (accountEnabled = false)
they will be blocked from sign-in in the target. This is not a deletion, but an
updated to the accountEnabled property.
Users are not soft deleted from the target tenant in this scenario:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add a user to a group and assign it to the cross-tenant synchronization
configuration in the source tenant.</li>
<li>Provision the user on-demand or through the incremental cycle.</li>
<li>Update the account enabled status to false on the user in the source tenant.</li>
<li>Provision the user on-demand or through the incremental cycle. The account
enabled status is changed to false in the target tenant.</li>
<li>Remove the user from the group in the source tenant.Integration
Deprovisioning</li>
</ol>
<p>Does cross-tenant synchronization support restoring users?
If the user in the source tenant is restored, reassigned to the app, meets the
scoping condition again within 30 days of soft deletion, it will be restored in the
target tenant.
IT admins can also manually restore  the user directly in the target tenant.
How can I deprovision all the users that are currently in scope of cross-tenant
synchronization?
Unassign all users and / or groups from the cross-tenant synchronization
configuration. This will trigger all the users that were unassigned, either directly or
through group membership, to be deprovisioned in subsequent sync cycles. Please
note that the target tenant will need to keep the inbound policy for sync enabled
until deprovisioning is complete. If the scope is set to Sync all user s and gr oups ,
you will also need to change it to Sync only assigned user s and gr oups . The users
will be automatically soft deleted by cross-tenant synchronization. The users will be
automatically hard deleted after 30 days or you can choose to hard delete the
users directly from the target tenant. Y ou can choose to hard delete the users
directly in the target tenant or wait 30 days for the users to be automatically hard
deleted.
If the sync relationship is severed, are external users previously managed by cross-
tenant synchronization deleted in the target tenant?
No. No changes are made to the external users previously managed by cross-
tenant synchronization if the relationship is severed (for example, if the cross-
tenant synchronization policy is deleted).

<p>Multitenant organization identity
provisioning for Microsoft 365
Article •04/24/2024
The multitenant organization capability is designed for organizations that own multiple
Microsoft Entra tenants and want to streamline intra-organization cross-tenant
collaboration in Microsoft 365. It&#39;s built on the premise of reciprocal provisioning of B2B
member users across multitenant organization tenants.
Teams external access  and Teams shared channels  excluded, Microsoft 365 people
search  is typically scoped to within local tenant boundaries. In multitenant organizations
with increased need for cross-tenant coworker collaboration, it&#39;s recommended to
reciprocally provision users from their home tenants into the resource tenants of
collaborating coworkers.
The new Microsoft T eams  experience improves upon Microsoft 365 people search and
Teams external access for a unified seamless collaboration experience. For this improved
experience to light up, the multitenant organization representation in Microsoft Entra ID
is required and collaborating users shall be provisioned as B2B members. For more
information, see Announcing more seamless collaboration in Microsoft T eams for
multitenant organizations .
Collaboration in Microsoft 365 is built on the premise of reciprocal provisioning of B2B
identities across multitenant organization tenants.
For example, say Annie in tenant A, Bob and Barbara in tenant B, and Charlie in tenant C
want to collaborate. Conceptually, these four users represent a collaborating user set of
four internal identities across three tenants.Microsoft 365 people search
New Microsoft Teams
Collaborating user set</p>
<p>For people search to succeed, while scoped to local tenant boundaries, the entire
collaborating user set must be represented within the scope of each multitenant
organization tenant A, B, and C, in the form of either internal or B2B identities.
Depending on your organization’s needs, the collaborating user set may contain a
subset of collaborating employees, or eventually all employees.
One of the simpler ways to achieve a collaborating user set in each multitenant
organization tenant is for each tenant administrator to define their user contribution
and synchronization them outbound. T enant administrators on the receiving end should
accept the shared users inbound.
Administrator A contributes or shares Annie
Administrator B contributes or shares Bob and Barbara
Administrator C contributes or shares Charles

<p>Microsoft 365 admin center facilitates orchestration of such a collaborating user set

Alternatively, pair-wise configuration of inbound and outbound cross-tenant
synchronization can be used to orchestrate such collating user set across multitenant
organization tenants. For more information, see What is a cross-tenant synchronization .
To ensure a seamless collaboration experience across the multitenant organization in

<p>From a security perspective, you should review the default permissions granted to B2B

To change the userT ype from Guest  to Member  (or vice versa), a source tenant
administrator can amend the attribute mappings , or a target tenant administrator can
change the userT ype if the property is not recurringly synchronized.
To unshare users, you deprovision users by using the user deprovisioning capabilities
available in Microsoft Entra cross-tenant synchronization. By default, when provisioning
scope is reduced while a synchronization job is running, users fall out of scope and are
soft deleted, unless T arget Object Actions for Delete is disabled. For more information,

<p>Multitenant organization optional policy
templates
Article •04/23/2024
Administrators staying in control of their resources is a guiding principle for multitenant
organization collaboration. Cross-tenant access settings are required for each tenant-to-
tenant relationship. T enant administrators explicitly configure cross-tenant access
partner configurations and identity synchronization settings for partner tenants inside
the multitenant organization.
To help apply homogenous cross-tenant access settings to partner tenants in the
multitenant organization, the administrator of each tenant can configure optional cross-
tenant access settings templates dedicated to the multitenant organization. This article
describes how to use templates to preconfigure cross-tenant access settings that are
applied to any partner tenant newly joining the multitenant organization.
Within a multitenant organization, each pair of tenants must have bi-directional cross-
tenant access settings , for both, partner configuration and identity synchronization.
These settings provide the underlying policy framework for enabling trust and for
sharing users and applications.
When your tenant joins a new multitenant organization, or when a partner tenant joins
your existing multitenant organization, cross-tenant access settings to other partner
tenants in the enlarged multitenant organization, if they don&#39;t already exist, are
automatically generated in an unconfigured state. In an unconfigured state, these cross-
tenant access settings pass through the default settings .
Default cross-tenant access settings apply to all external tenants for which you haven&#39;t
created organization-specific customized settings. T ypically, these settings are
configured to be nontrusting. For example, cross-tenant trusts for multifactor
authentication and compliant device claims might be disabled and user and group
sharing in B2B direct connect or B2B collaboration might be disallowed.
In multitenant organizations, on the other hand, cross-tenant access settings are
typically expected to be trusting. For example, cross-tenant trusts for multifactor
authentication and compliant device claims might be enabled and user and group
sharing in B2B direct connect or B2B collaboration might be allowed.Autogeneration of cross-tenant access setting s</p>
<p>While the autogeneration of cross-tenant access settings for multitenant organization
partner tenants in and of itself doesn&#39;t change any authentication or authorization policy
behavior, it allows your organization to easily customize the cross-tenant access settings
for partner tenants in the multitenant organization on a per-tenant basis.
As previously described, in multitenant organizations, cross-tenant access settings are
typically expected to be trusting. For example, cross-tenant trusts for multifactor
authentication and compliant device claims might be enabled and user and group
sharing in B2B direct connect or B2B collaboration might be allowed.
While autogeneration of cross-tenant access settings, per previous section, guarantees
the existence of cross-tenant access settings for every multitenant organization partner
tenant, further maintenance of the cross-tenant access settings for multitenant
organization partner tenants is conducted individually, on a per-tenant basis.
To reduce the workload for administrators at the time of multitenant organization
formation, you can optionally use policy templates for preemptive configuration of
cross-tenant access settings. These template settings are applied at the time of your
tenant joins a multitenant organization to all external multitenant organization partner
tenants as well as at the time of any partner tenant joins your existing multitenant
organization to such new partner tenant.
Enablement or configuration of the optional policy templates , at the time of a partner
tenant joins a multitenant organization, preemptively amend the corresponding cross-
tenant access settings , for both partner configuration and identity synchronization.
As an example, consider the actions of the administrators for an anticipated multitenant
organization with three tenants, A, B, and C.
The administrators of all three tenants enable and configure their respective
optional policy templates to enable cross-tenant trusts for multifactor
authentication and compliant device claims and to allow user and group sharing in
B2B direct connect and B2B collaboration.
Administrator A creates the multitenant organization and adds tenants B and C as
pending tenants to the multitenant organization.
Administrator B joins the multitenant organization. Cross-tenant access settings in
tenant A for partner tenant B are amended, according to tenant A policy template
settings. Vice versa, cross-tenant access settings in tenant B for partner tenant A
are amended, according to tenant B policy template settings.Policy templates at multitenant organization
formation</p>
<p>Administrator C joins the multitenant organization. Cross-tenant access settings in
tenants A (and B) for partner tenant C are amended, according to tenant A (and B)
policy template settings. Similarly, cross-tenant access settings in tenant C for
partner tenants A and B are amended, according to tenant C policy template
settings.
Following the formation of this multitenant organization of three tenants, the
cross-tenant access settings of all tenant pairs in the multitenant organization have
preemptively been configured.
In summary, configuration of the optional policy templates enable you to
homogeneously initialize cross-tenant access settings across your multitenant
organization, while maintaining maximum flexibility to customize your cross-tenant
access settings as needed on a per-tenant basis.
To stop using the policy templates, you can reset them to their default state. For more
information, see Configure multitenant organization templates .
To provide administrators with further configurability, you can choose when cross-
tenant access settings are to be amended according to the policy templates. For
example, you can choose to apply the policy templates for the following tenants when a
tenant joins a multitenant organization:
Tenant Descr iption
Only new partner tenants Tenants whose cross-tenant access settings are autogenerated
Only existing partner tenants Tenants who already have cross-tenant access settings
All partner tenants Both new partner tenants and existing partner tenants
No partner tenants Policy templates are effectively disabled
In this context, new partners refer to tenants for which you haven&#39;t yet configured cross-
tenant access settings, while existing  partners refer to tenants for which you have
already configured cross-tenant access settings. This scoping is specified with the
templateApplicationLevel property on the cross-tenant access partner configuration
template  and the templateApplicationLevel property on the cross-tenant access
identity synchronization template .Policy template scoping and additional
properties
ﾉExpand table</p>
<p>Finally, in terms of interpretation of template property values, any template property
value of null has no effect on the corresponding property value in the targeted cross-
tenant access settings, while a defined template property value causes the
corresponding property value in the targeted cross-tenant access settings to be
amended in accordance with the template. The following table illustrates how template
property values are being applied to corresponding cross-tenant access setting values.

When a multitenant organization is formed in Microsoft 365 admin center, an
administrator agrees to the following multitenant organization template settings:

If you view Microsoft Entra cross-tenant synchronization in Microsoft Entra admin

Microsoft Entra cross-tenant synchronization doesn&#39;t support establishing a cross-

The promotion of B2B guests to B2B members represents a strategic decision by
multitenant organizations to consider B2B members as trusted users of the

To promote B2B guests to B2B members, a source tenant administrator can amend
the attribute mappings , or a target tenant administrator can change the userT ype if
the property is not recurringly synchronized.
As your organization rolls out the multitenant organization functionality including
provisioning of B2B users across multitenant organization tenants, you might want
to provision some users as B2B guests, while provision others users as B2B
members. T o achieve this, you might want to establish two Microsoft Entra cross-
tenant synchronization configurations in the source tenant, one with userT ype
attribute mappings configured to B2B guest, and another with userT ype attribute
mappings configured to B2B member, each with Apply this mapping  set toMicrosoft apps

<p>Topologies for cross-tenant
collaboration
Article •11/03/2023
Organizations often find themselves managing multiple tenants due to mergers and
acquisitions, regulatory requirements, or administrative boundaries. R egardless of your
scenario, Microsoft Entra offers a flexible and ready-to-use solution for provisioning
accounts across tenants and facilitating seamless collaboration. Microsoft Entra
accommodates the following three models and can adapt to your evolving
organizational needs.
The hub and spoke topology presents two common patterns:
Option 1 (application hub):  In this option, you can integrate commonly used
applications into a central hub tenant that users from across the organization can
access.
Option 2 (user hub):  Alternatively, option 2 centralizes all your users in a single
tenant and provisions them into spoke tenants where resources are managed.
Let&#39;s examine a few real-world scenarios and see how they align with each of these
models.
During mergers and acquisitions, the ability to quickly enable collaboration is crucial,
allowing businesses to function cohesively while complex IT decisions are being made.
For instance, when a newly acquired company&#39;s employees need immediate access to
applications such as the internal help desk ticketing system or benefits application,
cross-tenant synchronization proves invaluable. This synchronization process allows
users from the acquired company to be provisioned into the application hub from day
one, granting them access to SaaS apps, on-premises applications, and other cloud
resources. Within the target tenant, admins can set up access packages to grant time
limited access to additional applications such as Salesforce and Amazon W eb ServicesHub and spoke＂
Mesh＂
Just-in-time＂
Hub and spoke
Mergers and acquisitions (application hub)</p>
<p>that contain business critical data. The following diagram shows recently acquired
tenants on the left and their users being provisioned into the parent company&#39;s tenant,
which grants users access to the necessary resources.
As organizations scale their usage of Azure, they often create dedicated tenants for
managing critical Azure resources. Meanwhile, they rely on a central hub tenant for user
provisioning. This model empowers administrators in the hub tenant to establish central
security and governance policies while granting development teams greater autonomy
and agility to deploy required Azure resources. Cross-tenant synchronization supports
this topology by enabling administrators to provision a subset of users into the spoke
tenants and manage the lifecycle of those users.Separate collaboration and resource tenants
(user hub)</p>
<p>While some companies centralize their users within a single tenant, others have a more
decentralized structure with applications, HR systems, and Active Directory domains
integrated into each tenant. Cross-tenant synchronization offers the flexibility to choose
which users are provisioned into each tenant.
In this scenario, each tenant represents a different company within the same parent
organization. Administrators in each tenant choose a subset of users to provision into
the target tenant. This solution provides flexibility for each tenant to operate
independently, while facilitating collaboration when users need access to critical
resources.Mesh
Collaborate within a portfolio company (partial-mesh)</p>
<p>Cross-tenant synchronization is one way. An internal member user can be synchronized
into multiple tenants as an external user. When the topology shows a synchronization
going in both directions, it&#39;s a distinct set of users in each direction and each arrow is a
separate configuration.
In this scenario, the organization has designated different tenants for each business unit.
The business units work closely together, in particular using Microsoft T eams. As a result,
each tenant has chosen to provision all users across the four tenants in the organization.
As new users join the company or leave, the provisioning service takes care of creating
and deleting users. The organization has also configured a multitenant organization that
includes all four tenants. Now when users need to collaborate in T eams, they&#39;re able to
easily find users across the company and start chats and meetings with those users.Collaborate across business units (full-mesh)</p>
<p>While the scenarios discussed so far cover collaboration within an organization, there
are cases where cross-organization collaboration is vital. This could be in the context of
joint ventures or organizations of independent legal entities. By employing connected
organizations and entitlement management, you can define policies for accessing
resources across connected organizations and enable users to request access to the
resources they need.
Consider Contoso and Litware, separate organizations engaged in a multi-year joint
venture. They need to collaborate closely. Administrators at Contoso have defined
access packages containing the resources required by Litware users. When a new
Litware employee needs access to Contoso&#39;s resources, they can request access to the
access package. Upon approval, they are provisioned with the necessary resources.
Access can be time-limited and subject to periodic review to ensure compliance with
Contoso&#39;s governance requirements.

using connected organizations and entitlement management.Just-in-time

<p>Governance and cross-tenant
synchronization
Article •03/21/2024
Cross-tenant synchronization is a flexible and ready-to-use solution to provision
accounts and facilitate seamless collaboration across tenants in an organization. Cross-
tenant synchronization automatically manages user identity lifecycle across tenants. It
provisions, synchronizes, and deprovisions users in the scope of synchronization from
source tenants.
This article describes how Microsoft Entra ID Governance  customers can use cross-
tenant synchronization to manage identity and access lifecycles across multitenant
organizations.
In this example, Contoso is a multitenant organization with three production Microsoft
Entra tenants. Contoso is deploying cross-tenant synchronization and Microsoft Entra ID
Governance features to address the following scenarios:
Manage employee identity lifecycles across multiple tenants
Use workflows to automate lifecycle processes for employees that originate in
other tenants
Assign resource access automatically to employees that originate in other tenants
Allow employees to request access to resources in multiple tenants
Review the access of synchronized users
From a cross-tenant synchronization perspective, Contoso Europe, Middle East, and
Africa (Contoso EMEA) and Contoso United S tates (Contoso US) are source tenants and
Contoso is a target tenant. The following diagram illustrates the topology.Deployment example</p>
<p>This supported topology for cross-tenant synchronization  is one of many in Microsoft
Entra ID. T enants can be a source tenant, a target tenant, or both. In the following
sections, learn how cross-tenant synchronization and Microsoft Entra ID Governance
features address several scenarios.
Cross-tenant synchronization in Microsoft Entra ID  automates creating, updating, and
deleting B2B collaboration users.
When organizations create, or provision, a B2B collaboration user in a tenant, user
access depends partly on how the organization provisioned them: Guest or Member
user type. When you select user type, consider the various properties of a Microsoft
Entra B2B collaboration user . The Member user type is suitable if users are part of the
larger multitenant organization and need member-level access to resources in the
organizational tenants. Microsoft T eams requires the Member user type in multitenant
organizations .
By default, cross-tenant synchronization includes commonly used attributes on the user
object in Microsoft Entra ID. The following diagram illustrates this scenario.Manage employee lifecycles across tenants</p>
<p>Organizations use the attributes to help create dynamic membership of groups and
access packages in the source and target tenant. Some Microsoft Entra ID features have
user attributes to target, such as lifecycle workflow user scoping.
To remove, or deprovision, a B2B collaboration user from a tenant automatically stops
access to resources in that tenant. This configuration is relevant when employees leave
an organization.
Microsoft Entra ID lifecycle workflows are an identity governance feature to manage
Microsoft Entra users. Organizations can automate joiner, mover, and leaver processes.
With cross-tenant synchronization, multitenant organizations can configure lifecycle
workflows to run automatically for B2B collaboration users it manages. For example,
configure a user onboarding workflow, triggered by the createdDateTime event user
attribute, to request access package assignment for new B2B collaboration users. Use
attributes such as userType and userPrincipalName to scope lifecycle workflows for
users homed in other tenants the organization owns.
Multitenant organizations can ensure B2B collaboration users have access to shared
resources in a target tenant. Users can request access, where needed. In the following
scenarios, see how the identity governance feature, entitlement management  access
packages govern resource access.Automate lifecycle processes with workflows
Govern synchronized user access with access
packages
Automatically assign access in target tenants to
employees from source tenants</p>
<p>The term birthright assignment refers to automatically granting resource access based
on one or more user properties. T o configure birthright assignment, create automatic
assignment policies for access packages  in entitlement management and configure
resource roles to grant shared resource access.
Organizations manage cross-tenant synchronization configuration in the source tenant.
Therefore, organizations can delegate resource access management to other source
tenant administrators for synchronized B2B collaboration users:
In the source tenant, administrators configure cross-tenant synchronization
attribute mappings for the users that require cross-tenant resource access
In the target tenant, administrators use attributes in automatic assignment policies
to determine access package membership for synchronized B2B collaboration
users
To drive automatic assignment policies in the target tenant, synchronize default
attribute mappings, such as department or map directory extensions, in the source
tenant.
With identity governance access package  policies, multitenant organizations can allow
B2B collaboration users, created by cross-tenant synchronization, to request access to
shared resources in a target tenant. This process is useful if employees need just-in-time
(JIT) access to a resource that another tenant owns.
Access reviews in Microsoft Entra ID  enable organizations to manage group
memberships, access to enterprise applications, and role assignments. R egularly review
user access to ensure the right people have access.
When resource access configuration doesn’t automatically assign access, such as with
dynamic groups or access packages, configure access reviews to apply the results to
resources upon completion. The following sections describe how multitenant
organizations can configure access reviews for users across tenants in source and target
tenants.Enable source-tenant employees to request access to
target-tenant shared resources
Review synchronized-user access
Review source-tenant user access</p>
<p>Multitenant organizations can include internal users in access reviews. This action
enables access recertification in source tenants that synchronizes users. Use this
approach for regular review of security groups assigned to cross-tenant synchronization.
Therefore, ongoing B2B collaboration access to other tenants has approval in the user
home tenant.
Use access reviews of users in source tenants to avoid potential conflicts between cross-
tenant synchronization and access reviews that remove denied users upon completion.
Organizations can include B2B collaboration users in access reviews, including users
provisioned by cross-tenant synchronization in target tenants. This option enables
access recertification of resources in target tenants. Although organizations can target
all users in access reviews, guest users can be explicitly targeted if necessary.
For organizations that synchronize B2B collaboration users, typically Microsoft doesn’t
recommend removing denied guest users automatically from access reviews. Cross-
tenant synchronization reprovisions the users if they&#39;re in the synchronization scope.

<p>Govern access for security operations
center (SOC) teams in a multitenant
environment
Article •05/02/2024
Managing multitenant environments can add another layer of complexity when it comes
to keeping up with the ever-evolving security threats facing your enterprise. Navigating
across multiple tenants can be time consuming and reduce the overall efficiency of
security operation center (SOC) teams. Multitenant management in Microsoft Defender
XDR provides security operation teams with a single, unified view of all the tenants they
manage. This view enables teams to quickly investigate incidents and perform advanced
hunting across data from multiple tenants, improving their security operations.
Microsoft Entra ID Governance  enables you to govern the access and lifecycle of the
users who are members of the SOC teams and threat hunter teams. This document
explores:
The controls you can put in place for SOC teams to securely access resources
across tenants.
Example topologies for how you can implement your lifecycle and access controls.
Deployment considerations (roles, monitoring, APIs).
Microsoft Entra provides the controls needed to govern the lifecycle of a SOC user and
to securely provide access to the resources they need. In this document, the term source
tenant refers to where the SOC users originate and authenticate against. T arget tenant
refers to the tenant that they&#39;re investigating when there&#39;s an incident. Organizations
have multiple target tenants due to mergers and acquisitions, aligning tenants with
business units, and aligning tenants with geos.
Entitlement management, thr ough access p ackages and connect ed or ganizations
allows the target tenant administrator to define collections of resources (ex: app roles,
directory roles, and groups) that users from the source tenant can request access to. If
the user is approved for the resources they need, but don’t yet have a B2B account,
entitlement management will automatically create a B2B account for the user in theManage the lifecycle and access of a SOC user

You can use entitlement management and cross-tenant access policies to control access
to resources across tenants. Entitlement management will assign the right users to the
right resources, while cross-tenant access policies and conditional access together
perform the necessary run-time checks to ensure the right users are accessing the right
resources.
Entitlement management
Assigning Microsoft Entra roles through entitlement management access packages
helps to efficiently manage role assignments at scale and improves the role assignment
lifecycle. It provides a flexible request and approval process for gaining access to
directory roles, app roles, and groups while also enabling automatic assignment to
resources based on user attributes.ﾉExpand table

Cross-t enant access policies
External identities cross-tenant access settings manage how you collaborate with other
Microsoft Entra organizations through B2B collaboration. These settings determine both
the level of inbound access users in external Microsoft Entra organizations have to your
resources, and the level of outbound access your users have to external organizations.
Learn more
This section describes how you can use tools such as cross-tenant synchronization,
entitlement management, cross-tenant access policies, and conditional access together.
In both topologies, the target tenant admin has full control over access to resources in
the target tenant. They differ in who initiates provisioning and deprovisioning.
In topology 1, the source tenant configures entitlement management and cross-tenant
synchronization to provision users into the target tenant. Then, the administrator of the
target tenant configures access packages to provide access to the necessary directory
roles, group, and app roles in the target tenant.
Steps t o configur e topology 1Deployment topologies
Topology 1
</p>
<ol>
<li>In the source tenant, configure cross-tenant synchronization  to provision internal
accounts in the source tenant as external accounts in the target tenant.
As users are assigned to the cross-tenant synchronization service principal, they&#39;ll
automatically be provisioned into the target tenant. As they&#39;re removed from the
configuration, they&#39;ll automatically be deprovisioned. As part of your attribute
mappings, you can add a new mapping of type constant to provision a directory
extension  attribute on the user to indicate that they&#39;re a SOC administrator.
Alternatively, if you have an attribute such as department that you can rely on for
this step, you can skip creating the extension. This attribute will be used in the
target tenant to provide them with access to the necessary roles.</li>
<li>In the source tenant, create an access package that includes the cross-tenant
synchronization service principal as a resource.
As users are granted access to the package, they&#39;ll be assigned to the cross-tenant
synchronization service principal. Ensure that you set up periodic access reviews of
the access package or time-limit the assignments to ensure that only the users that
need access to the target tenant continue to have access.</li>
<li>In the target tenant, create access packages  to provide the necessary roles for
investigating an incident.
We recommend one autoassigned  access package to provide the Security R eader
role and one request based package for the Security Operator and Security
Administrator roles.
Once you have completed the setup, SOC users can navigate to myaccess.microsoft.com
to request time-limited access to the necessary access packages in the source tenant.
Once approved, they&#39;ll automatically be provisioned into the target tenant(s) with the
security reader role. They can then request additional access in any tenants where they
need the Security Operator or Security Administrator roles. Once their access period is
over or they&#39;re removed as part of an access review, they&#39;ll be deprovisioned from all the
target tenants they don&#39;t need access to anymore.
In topology 2 the target tenant administrator defines the access packages and resources
that the source users can request access to. If the source tenant administrator would like
to restrict which of their users can access the target tenant, you can use a cross-tenant
access policy coupled with an access package to block all access to the target tenant,
except for users that are part of a group that is included in an access package in the
home tenant.Topology 2</li>
</ol>
<p>Steps t o configur e topology 2</p>
<ol>
<li>In the target tenant, add the source tenant as a connected organization .
This setting allows the target tenant administrator to make access packages
available to the source tenant.</li>
<li>In the target tenant, create an access package that provides the Security R eader,
Security Administrator, and Security Operator roles.</li>
<li>Users from the source tenant can now request access packages in the target
tenant.
Once you have completed the setup, SOC users can navigate to myaccess.microsoft.com
to request time-limited access to the necessary roles in each tenant.
Topologies comp ared
In both topologies, the target tenant can control what resources users have access to.
This can be accomplished using a mix of cross-tenant access policies, conditional access,
and assignment of apps and roles to users. They differ in who configures and initiates
provisioning. In topology 1, the source tenant configures provisioning and pushes users
into the target tenants. In topology 2, the target tenant defines which users are eligible
to access their tenant.
If a user needs access to several tenants at one time, topology 1 makes it easy for them
to request access to an access package in one tenant and automatically get provisioned
into several tenants. If the target tenant wants to ensure full control over who is

provisioning and cause the service to reevaluate all the users again.
The time between provisioning cycles is currently not configurable.
The app provisioning service isn&#39;t aware of changes made in external apps. So, no action

made by the provisioning service in the cloud. Microsoft is working on a dedicated
capability for group or user writeback. Upvote the UserV oice feedback on this
website  to track the status of the preview. Alternatively, you can use Microsoft
Identity Manager  for user or group writeback from Microsoft Entra ID to Active
Directory.
By using on-premises provisioning, you can take a user already in Microsoft Entra ID and
provision them into a third-party application. You can &#39;t bring a us er int o the dir ectory
from a thir d-party application.  Customers will need to rely on our native HR integrations,
Microsoft Entra Connect, Microsoft Identity Manager, or Microsoft Graph, to bring users
into the directory.Microsoft Azure Government Cloud

<p>The following attributes and objects aren&#39;t supported:
Multivalued attributes.
Reference attributes (for example, manager).
Groups.
Complex anchors (for example, ObjectT ypeName+UserName).
Attributes that have characters such as &quot;.&quot; or &quot;[&quot;
Binary attributes.
On-premises applications are sometimes not federated with Microsoft Entra ID and
require local passwords. The on-premises provisioning preview doesn&#39;t support
password synchronization. Provisioning initial one-time passwords is supported.
Ensure that you&#39;re using the Redact  function to redact the passwords from the
logs. In the SQL and LD AP connectors, the passwords aren&#39;t exported on the initial
call to the application, but rather a second call with set password.
The Microsoft Entra ECMA Connector Host currently requires either an SSL certificate to
be trusted by Azure or the provisioning agent to be used. The certificate subject must
match the host name the Microsoft Entra ECMA Connector Host is installed on.
The Microsoft Entra ECMA Connector Host currently doesn&#39;t support anchor attribute
changes (renames) or target systems, which require multiple attributes to form an
anchor.
The attributes that the target application supports are discovered and surfaced in the
Microsoft Entra admin center in Attribut e Mappings . Newly added attributes will
continue to be discovered. If an attribute type has changed, for example, string to
Boolean, and the attribute is part of the mappings, the type won&#39;t change automatically
in the Microsoft Entra admin center. Customers will need to go into advanced settings in
mappings and manually update the attribute type.Attributes and objects

<p>The agent doesn&#39;t currently support auto update for the on-premises application

auto update is enabled by default and required for all customers.
The same provisioning agent can&#39;t be used for on-premises app provisioning and

The cross-tenant access partner configuration  handles trust settings and automatic user

trust multifactor authentication claims for inbound users from the target partner tenant.
With the template in an unconfigured state, partner configurations for partner tenants in
the multitenant organization won&#39;t be amended, with all trust settings passed through
from default settings. However, if you configure the template, then partner
configurations will be amended corresponding to the policy template.
To specify which trust settings and automatic user consent settings to apply to your

The Microsoft Entra provisioning service allows you to define who will be provisioned in
one or both of the following ways:
Based on assignment to the configuration
Based on attributes of the user
Start small. T est with a small set of users before rolling out to everyone. When the scope
for provisioning is set to assigned users and groups, you can control it by assigning one
or two users to the configuration. Y ou can further refine who is in scope for provisioning
by creating attribute-based scoping filters, described in the next step .</li>
<li><p>In the source tenant, select Provisioning  and expand the Settings  section.

Step 7: Define who is in scope for provisioning</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the Scope  list, select whether to synchronize all users in the source tenant or
only users assigned to the configuration.
It&#39;s recommended that you select Sync only assigned user s and gr oups  instead of
Sync all user s and gr oups . Reducing the number of users in scope improves
performance.</p>
</li>
<li>If you made any changes, select Save.</li>
<li>On the configuration page, select Users and gr oups .
For cross-tenant synchronization to work, at least one internal user must be
assigned to the configuration.</li>
<li>Select Add user/gr oup.</li>
<li>On the Add Assignment  page, under Users and gr oups , select None Select ed.</li>
<li>On the Users and gr oups  pane, search for and select one or more internal users or
groups you want to assign to the configuration.
If you select a group to assign to the configuration, only users that are direct
members in the group will be in scope for provisioning. Y ou can select a static
group or a dynamic group. The assignment doesn&#39;t cascade to nested groups.</li>
<li><p>Select Select .
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select Assign .
For more information, see Assign users and groups to an application .
Sour ce tenant
Regardless of the value you selected for Scope  in the previous step, you can further limit
which users are synchronized by creating attribute-based scoping filters.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the source tenant, select Provisioning  and expand the Mappings  section.

Step 8: (Optional) Define who is in scope for
provisioning with scoping filters</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select Provision Micr osoft Entra ID User s to open the Attribut e Mapping  page.</p>
</li>
<li>Under Sour ce Object Scope , select All records.</li>
<li>On the Sour ce Object Scope  page, select Add scoping filt er.</li>
<li>Add any scoping filters to define which users are in scope for provisioning.

</li>
</ol>
<p>To configure scoping filters, refer to the instructions provided in Scoping users or
groups to be provisioned with scoping filters .</p>
<ol>
<li>Select Ok and Save to save any changes.
If you added a filter, you&#39;ll see a message that saving your changes will result in all
assigned users and groups being resynchronized. This may take a long time
depending on the size of your directory.</li>
<li>Select Yes and close the Attribut e Mapping  page.

Attribute mappings allow you to define how data should flow between the source
tenant and target tenant. For information on how to customize the default attribute
mappings, see Tutorial - Customize user provisioning attribute-mappings for SaaS
applications in Microsoft Entra ID .</li>
<li>In the source tenant, select Provisioning  and expand the Mappings  section.</li>
<li>Select Provision Micr osoft Entra ID User s.</li>
<li>On the Attribut e Mapping  page, scroll down to review the user attributes that are
synchronized between tenants in the Attribut e Mappings  section.

Step 9: Review attribute mappings</li>
</ol>
<p>The first attribute, alternativeSecurityIdentifier, is an internal attribute used to
uniquely identify the user across tenants, match users in the source tenant with
existing users in the target tenant, and ensure that each user only has one account.
The matching attribute cannot be changed. Attempting to change the matching
attribute or adding additional matching attributes will result in a schemaInvalid
error.</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the Member (userT ype) attribute to open the Edit A ttribut e page.</li>
<li>Review the Constant V alue setting for the userT ype attribute.
This setting defines the type of user that will be created in the target tenant and
can be one of the values in the following table. By default, users will be created as
external member (B2B collaboration users). For more information, see Properties of
a Microsoft Entra B2B collaboration user .
Constant
ValueDescr iption
Member Default. Users will be created as external member (B2B collaboration users) in

Step 11: Test provision on demand</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that you have a configuration, you can test on-demand provisioning with one of
your users.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the source tenant, browse to Identity  &gt; External Identities  &gt; Cross-t enant
synchr onization .</li>
<li>Select Configurations  and then select your configuration.</li>
<li>Select Provision on demand .</li>
<li>In the Select a user or gr oup box, search for and select one of your test users.</li>
<li>Select Provision .
After a few moments, the Perform action  page appears with information about the
provisioning of the test user in the target tenant.
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the user isn&#39;t in scope, you&#39;ll see a page with information about why test user
was skipped.
On the Provision on demand  page, you can view details about the provision and
have the option to retry.

</p>
<ol>
<li>In the target tenant, verify that the test user was provisioned.</li>
<li>If all is working as expected, assign additional users to the configuration.
For more information, see On-demand provisioning in Microsoft Entra ID .

Step 12: Start the provisioning job</li>
</ol>
<p>Sour ce tenant
The provisioning job starts the initial synchronization cycle of all users defined in Scope
of the Settings  section. The initial cycle takes longer to perform than subsequent cycles,
which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Microsoft Entra provisioning
service is running.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the source tenant, browse to Identity  &gt; External Identities  &gt; Cross-t enant
synchr onization .</li>
<li>Select Configurations  and then select your configuration.</li>
<li>On the Overview  page, review the provisioning details.</li>
<li>Select Start provisioning  to start the provisioning job.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sour ce and tar get t enants
Once you&#39;ve started a provisioning job, you can monitor the status.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the source tenant, on the Overview  page, check the progress bar to see the
status of the provisioning cycle and how close it&#39;s to completion. For more
information, see Check the status of user provisioning .

Step 13: Monitor provisioning</li>
</ol>
<p>If provisioning seems to be in an unhealthy state, the configuration will go into
quarantine. For more information, see Application provisioning in quarantine
status .</p>
<ol>
<li>Select Provisioning logs  to determine which users have been provisioned
successfully or unsuccessfully. By default, the logs are filtered by the service
principal ID of the configuration. For more information, see Provisioning logs in
Microsoft Entra ID .</li>
<li>Select Audit logs  to view all logged events in Microsoft Entra ID. For more

<p>You can also view audit logs in the target tenant.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the target tenant, select Users &gt; Audit logs  to view logged events for user
management.
Target t enant
Even though users are being provisioned in the target tenant, they still might be able to
remove themselves. If users remove themselves and they are in scope, they&#39;ll be
provisioned again during the next provisioning cycle. If you want to disallow the ability
for users to remove themselves from your organization, you must configure the External
user leav e settings .</li>
<li>In the target tenant, browse to Identity  &gt; External Identities  &gt; External
collaboration settings .</li>
<li>Under External user leav e settings , choose whether to allow external users to
leave your organization themselves.


Step 14: Configure leave setting s</li>
</ol>
<p>This setting also applies to B2B collaboration and B2B direct connect, so if you set
External user leav e settings  to No, B2B collaboration users and B2B direct connect users
can&#39;t leave your organization themselves. For more information, see Leave an
organization as an external user .

<p>Scoping users or groups to be
provisioned with scoping filters
Article •01/18/2024
Learn how to use scoping filters in the Microsoft Entra provisioning service to define
attribute based rules. The rules are used to determine which users or groups are
provisioned.
You use scoping filters to prevent objects in applications that support automated user
provisioning from being provisioned if an object doesn&#39;t satisfy your business
requirements. A scoping filter allows you to include or exclude any users who have an
attribute that matches a specific value. For example, when provisioning users from
Microsoft Entra ID to a SaaS application used by a sales team, you can specify that only
users with a &quot;Department&quot; attribute of &quot;Sales&quot; should be in scope for provisioning.
Scoping filters can be used differently depending on the type of provisioning connector:
Outbound pr ovisioning fr om Micr osoft Entra ID t o SaaS applications . When
Microsoft Entra ID is the source system, user and group assignments  are the most
common method for determining which users are in scope for provisioning. These
assignments also are used for enabling single sign-on and provide a single method
to manage access and provisioning. Scoping filters can be used optionally, in
addition to assignments or instead of them, to filter users based on attribute
values.
Inbound pr ovisioning fr om HCM applications t o Micr osoft Entra ID and Activ e
Directory. When an HCM application such as W orkday  is the source system,
scoping filters are the primary method for determining which users should be
provisioned from the HCM application to Active Directory or Microsoft Entra ID.Scoping filter use cases
 Tip
The more users and groups in scope for provisioning, the longer the
synchronization process can take. Setting the scope to sync assigned users
and groups, limiting the number of groups assigned to the app, and limiting
the size of the groups will reduce the time it takes to synchronize everyone
that is in scope.</p>
<p>By default, Microsoft Entra provisioning connectors don&#39;t have any attribute-based
scoping filters configured.
A scoping filter consists of one or more claus es. Clauses determine which users are
allowed to pass through the scoping filter by evaluating each user&#39;s attributes. For
example, you might have one clause that requires that a user&#39;s &quot;S tate&quot; attribute equals
&quot;New Y ork&quot;, so only New Y ork users are provisioned into the application.
A single clause defines a single condition for a single attribute value. If multiple clauses
are created in a single scoping filter, they&#39;re evaluated together using &quot;AND&quot; logic. The
&quot;AND&quot; logic means all clauses must evaluate to &quot;true&quot; in order for a user to be
provisioned.
Finally, multiple scoping filters can be created for a single application. If multiple
scoping filters are present, they&#39;re evaluated together by using &quot;OR&quot; logic. The &quot;OR&quot;
logic means that if all the clauses in any of the configured scoping filters evaluate to
&quot;true&quot;, the user is provisioned.
Each user or group processed by the Microsoft Entra provisioning service is always
evaluated individually against each scoping filter.
As an example, consider the following scoping filter:
According to this scoping filter, users must satisfy the following criteria to be
provisioned:
They must be in New Y ork.Scoping filter construction</p>
<p>They must work in the Engineering department.
Their company employee ID must be between 1,000,000 and 2,000,000.
Their job title must not be null or empty.
Scoping filters are configured as part of the attribute mappings for each Microsoft Entra
user provisioning connector. The following procedure assumes that you already set up
automatic provisioning for one of the supported applications  and are adding a scoping
filter to it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in to the Microsoft Entra admin center  as at least a Application
Administrator .</li>
<li>Browse to Identity  &gt; Applications  &gt; Enterprise applications  &gt; All applications .</li>
<li>Select the application for which you have configured automatic provisioning: for
example, &quot;ServiceNow&quot;.</li>
<li>Select the Provisioning  tab.</li>
<li>In the Mappings  section, select the mapping that you want to configure a scoping
filter for: for example, &quot;S ynchronize Microsoft Entra users to ServiceNow&quot;.</li>
<li>Select the Sour ce object scope  menu.</li>
<li>Select Add scoping filt er.</li>
<li>Define a clause by selecting a source Attribut e Name , an Operat or, and an
Attribut e Value to match against. The following operators are supported:
a. &amp;. Clause returns &quot;true&quot; if the evaluated attribute exists in the input string value.
b. !&amp;. Clause returns &quot;true&quot; if the evaluated attribute does not exist in the input
string value.Create scoping filters
Create a scoping filter
 Tip
Steps in this article might vary slightly based on the portal you start from.</li>
</ol>
<p>c. ENDS_WITH . Clause returns &quot;true&quot; if the evaluated attribute ends with the input
string value.
d. EQUALS. Clause returns &quot;true&quot; if the evaluated attribute matches the input string
value exactly (case sensitive).
e. Greater_Than.  Clause returns &quot;true&quot; if the evaluated attribute is greater than the
value. The value specified on the scoping filter must be an integer and the
attribute on the user must be an integer [0,1,2,...].
f. Greater_Than_OR_EQU ALS. Clause returns &quot;true&quot; if the evaluated attribute is
greater than or equal to the value. The value specified on the scoping filter must
be an integer and the attribute on the user must be an integer [0,1,2,...].
g. Includes.  Clause returns &quot;true&quot; if the evaluated attribute contains the string

Saving a new scoping filter triggers a new full sync for the application, where all
users in the source system are evaluated again against the new scoping filter. If a
user in the application was previously in scope for provisioning, but falls out of
scope, their account is disabled or deprovisioned in the application. T o override this
default behavior, refer to Skip deletion for user accounts that go out o f scope .

<p>Enable accidental deletions prevention
in the Microsoft Entra provisioning
service
Article •10/23/2023
The Microsoft Entra provisioning service includes a feature to help avoid accidental
deletions. This feature ensures that users aren&#39;t disabled or deleted in an application
unexpectedly.
You use accidental deletions to specify a deletion threshold. Anything above the
threshold that you set requires an admin to explicitly allow the processing of the
deletions.
To enable accidental deletion prevention:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in to the Microsoft Entra admin center  as at least a Application
Administrator .</li>
<li>Browse to Identity  &gt; Applications  &gt; Enterprise applications .</li>
<li>Select your application.</li>
<li>Select Provisioning  and then on the provisioning page select Edit pr ovisioning .</li>
<li>Under Settings , select the Prevent accidental deletions  check box and specify a
deletion threshold.</li>
<li>Ensure the Notification Email  address is completed. If the deletion threshold is
met, an email is sent.</li>
<li>Select Save to save the changes.
When the deletion threshold is met, the job goes into quarantine, and a notification
email is sent. The quarantined job can then be allowed or rejected. T o learn more about
quarantine behavior, see Application provisioning in quarantine status .
When you encounter an accidental deletion, you see it on the provisioning status page.
It says Provisioning has been quarantined. See quarantine details for more
information.Configure accidental deletion prevention
Recovering from an accidental deletion</li>
</ol>
<p>You can click either Allow delet es or View pr ovisioning logs .
The Allow delet es action deletes the objects that triggered the accidental delete
threshold. Use the procedure to accept the deletions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Select Allow delet es.</li>
<li>Click Yes on the confirmation to allow the deletions.</li>
<li>View the confirmation that the deletions were accepted. The status returns to
healthy with the next cycle.
Investigate and reject deletions as necessary:
Investigate the source of the deletions. Y ou can use the provisioning logs for
details.
Prevent the deletion by assigning the user / group to the application (or
configuration) again, restoring the user / group, or updating your provisioning
configuration.
Once you&#39;ve made the necessary changes to prevent the user / group from being
deleted, restart provisioning. Don&#39;t restart provisioning until you&#39;ve made the
necessary changes to prevent the users / groups from being deleted.
You can test the feature by triggering disable / deletion events by setting the threshold
to a low number, for example 3, and then changing scoping filters, unassigning users,
and deleting users from the directory (see common scenarios in next section).
Let the provisioning job run (20 – 40 mins) and navigate back to the provisioning page.
Check the provisioning job in quarantine and choose to allow the deletions or review
the provisioning logs to understand why the deletions occurred.

configuration).
To learn more about deprovisioning scenarios, see How Application Provisioning W orks.
When a user is set for removal from the target application (or target tenant), it&#39;s counted
against the deletion threshold. Scenarios that could lead to a user being removed from
the target application (or target tenant) could include: unassigning the user from the
application (or configuration) and soft / hard deleting a user in the directory. Groups
evaluated for deletion count towards the deletion threshold. In addition to deletions, the
same functionality also works for disables.
It&#39;s evaluated each cycle. If the number of deletions doesn&#39;t exceed the threshold during
a single cycle, the “circuit breaker” isn&#39;t triggered. If multiple cycles are needed to reach
a steady state, the deletion threshold is evaluated per cycle.
You can find users that should be disabled / deleted but haven’t due to the deletion
threshold. Navigation to Provisioning logs  and then filter Action  with StagedAction  or
StagedDelet e.

<p>The on-demand provisioning process attempts to show the steps that the provisioning
service takes when provisioning a user. There are typically five steps to provision a user.
One or more of those steps, explained in the following sections, are shown during the
on-demand provisioning experience.
The provisioning service attempts to authorize access to the target system by making a
request for a &quot;test user&quot;. The provisioning service expects a response that indicates that
the service authorized to continue with the provisioning steps. This step is shown only
when it fails. It&#39;s not shown during the on-demand provisioning experience when the
step is successful.
Ensure that you&#39;ve provided valid credentials, such as the secret token and tenant
URL, to the target system. The required credentials vary by application. For detailed
configuration tutorials, see the tutorial list .
Make sure that the target system supports filtering on the matching attributes
defined in the Attribut e mappings  pane. Y ou might need to check the API
documentation provided by the application developer to understand the
supported filters.
For S ystem for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) applications, you can

Understand the provisioning steps
Step 1: Test connection
Troubleshooting tips</p>
<p>to authorization requests in the way that the Microsoft Entra provisioning service
expects. Have a look at an example request .
Next, the provisioning service retrieves the user from the source system. The user
attributes that the service retrieves are used later to:
Evaluate whether the user is in scope for provisioning.
Check the target system for an existing user.
Determine what user attributes to export to the target system.
The View details  section shows the properties of the user that were imported from the
source system (for example, Microsoft Entra ID).
Importing the user can fail when the matching attribute is missing on the user
object in the source system. T o resolve this failure, try one of these approaches:
Update the user object with a value for the matching attribute.
Change the matching attribute in your provisioning configuration.
If an attribute that you expected is missing from the imported list, ensure that the
attribute has a value on the user object in the source system. The provisioning
service currently doesn&#39;t support provisioning null attributes.
Make sure that the Attribut e mapping  page of your provisioning configuration
contains the attribute that you expect.
Next, the provisioning service determines whether the user is in scope  for provisioning.
The service considers aspects such as:
Whether the user is assigned to the application.
Whether scope is set to Sync assigned  or Sync all .
The scoping filters defined in your provisioning configuration.Step 2: Import user
View details
Troubleshooting tips
Step 3: Determine if user is in scope
View details</p>
<p>The View details  section shows the scoping conditions that were evaluated. Y ou might
see one or more of the following properties:
Activ e in sour ce syst em indicates that the user has the property IsActive set to
true in Microsoft Entra ID.
Assigned t o application  indicates that the user is assigned to the application in
Microsoft Entra ID.
Scope sync all  indicates that the scope setting allows all users and groups in the
tenant.
User has r equir ed role indicates that the user has the necessary roles to be
provisioned into the application.
Scoping filt ers are also shown if you have defined scoping filters for your
application. The filter is displayed with the following format: {scoping filter title}
{scoping filter attribute} {scoping filter operator} {scoping filter value}.
Make sure that you&#39;ve defined a valid scoping role. For example, avoid using the
Greater_Than operator  with a noninteger value.
If the user doesn&#39;t have the necessary role, review the tips for provisioning users
assigned to the default access role .
In this step, the service attempts to match the user that was retrieved in the import step
with a user in the target system.
The View details  page shows the properties of the users that were matched in the target
system. The context pane changes as follows:
If no users are matched in the target system, no properties are shown.
If one user matches in the target system, the properties of that user are shown.
If multiple users match, the properties of both users are shown.
If multiple matching attributes are part of your attribute mappings, each matching
attribute is evaluated sequentially and the matched users for that attribute are
shown.Troubleshooting tips
Step 4: Match user between source and target
View details
Troubleshooting tips</p>
<p>The provisioning service might not be able to match a user in the source system
uniquely with a user in the target. R esolve this problem by ensuring that the
matching attribute is unique.
Make sure that the target system supports filtering on the attribute that&#39;s defined
as the matching attribute.
Finally, the provisioning service takes an action, such as creating, updating, deleting, or
skipping the user.
Here&#39;s an example of what you might see after the successful on-demand provisioning
of a user:
The View details  section displays the attributes that were modified in the target system.
This display represents the final output of the provisioning service activity and the
attributes that were exported. If this step fails, the attributes displayed represent the
attributes that the provisioning service attempted to modify.
Failures for exporting changes can vary greatly. Check the documentation for
provisioning logs  for common failures.
On-demand provisioning says the group or user can&#39;t be provisioned because
they&#39;re not assigned to the application. There&#39;s a replication delay of up to a fewStep 5: Perform action

minutes and try again.
Do y ou need t o turn pr ovisioning o ff to use on-demand pr ovisioning?  For
applications that use a long-lived bearer token or a user name and password for
authorization, no more steps are required. Applications that use O Auth for
authorization currently require the provisioning job to be stopped before using
on-demand provisioning. Applications such as G Suite, Box, W orkplace by
Facebook, and Slack fall into this category. W ork is in progress to support on-
demand provisioning for all applications without having to stop provisioning jobs.
How long does on-demand pr ovisioning tak e? On-demand provisioning typically
takes less than 30 seconds.
There are currently a few known limitations to on-demand provisioning. P ost your
suggestions and feedback  so we can better determine what improvements to make
next.
On-demand provisioning of groups supports updating up to five members at a
time. Connectors for cross-tenant synchronization, W orkday, etc. do not support
group provisioning and as a result do not support on-demand provisioning of
groups.
On-demand provisioning supports provisioning one user at a time through the
Microsoft Entra admin center.
Restoring a previously soft-deleted user in the target tenant with on-demand
provisioning isn&#39;t supported. If you try to soft-delete a user with on-demand
provisioning and then restore the user, it can result in duplicate users.

<p>Reference for writing expressions for
attribute ma ppings in Microsoft Entra ID
Article •01/26/2024
When you configure provisioning to a SaaS application, one of the types of attribute
mappings that you can specify is an expression mapping. For these mappings, you must
write a script-like expression that allows you to transform your users&#39; data into formats
that are more acceptable for the SaaS application.
The syntax for Expressions for Attribute Mappings is reminiscent of Visual Basic for
Applications (VBA) functions.
The entire expression must be defined in terms of functions, which consist of a
name followed by arguments in parentheses: FunctionName( &lt;&lt;argument 1&gt;&gt;,
&lt;<argument n="">&gt;)
You can nest functions within each other. For example:
FunctionOne(FunctionT wo(&lt;<argument1>&gt;))
You can pass three different types of arguments into functions:<p>
<ol>
<li>Attributes, which must be enclosed in square brackets. For example:
[attributeName]</li>
<li>String constants, which must be enclosed in double quotes. For example:
&quot;United S tates&quot;</li>
<li>Other Functions. For example: FunctionOne( &lt;<argument1>&gt;,
FunctionT wo(&lt;<argument2>&gt;))
For string constants, if you need a backslash ( \ ) or quotation mark ( &quot; ) in the
string, it must be escaped with the backslash ( \ ) symbol. For example: &quot;Company
name: &quot;Contoso&quot;&quot;
The syntax is case-sensitive, which must be considered while typing them as strings
in a function vs copy pasting them directly from here.Syntax overview

Expression Required Expression Expression to be evaluated
Example 1: Don &#39;t flow an attribut e if it is null
IgnoreFlowIfNullOrEmpty([department])
The above expression will drop the department attribute from the provisioning flow if it
is null or empty.
Example 2: Don &#39;t flow an attribut e if the expr ession mapping ev aluat es to empty
string or null
Let&#39;s say the SuccessF actors attribute prefix is mapped to the on-premises Active
Directory attribute personalTitle  using the following expression mapping:
IgnoreFlowIfNullOrEmpty(Switch([prefix], &quot;&quot;, &quot;3443&quot;, &quot;Dr.&quot;, &quot;3444&quot;, &quot;Prof.&quot;,
&quot;3445&quot;, &quot;Prof. Dr.&quot;))
The above expression first evaluates the Switch  function. If the prefix attribute doesn&#39;t
have any of the values listed within the Switch function, then Switch will return an empty
string and the attribute personalTitle  will not be included in the provisioning flow to on-
premises Active Directory.

valueIfF alse Required Variable or S tring If the condition evaluates to false, the

The following comparison operators can be used in the condition :
Equal to (=) and not equal to (&lt;&gt;)
Greater than (&gt;) and greater than equal to (&gt;=)
Less than (&lt;) and less than equal to (&lt;=)
Example:  Set the target attribute value to source country attribute if country=&quot;USA&quot;,
else set target attribute value to source department attribute. IIF([country]=&quot;USA&quot;,
[country],[department])
This section includes limitations and workarounds for the IIF function. For information
about troubleshooting user creation issues, see Creation fails due to null / empty values .
The IIF function currently doesn&#39;t support AND and OR logical operators.
To implement AND logic, use nested IIF statement chained along the trueValue
path. Example: If country=&quot;USA&quot; and state=&quot;CA&quot;, return value &quot;T rue&quot;, else return
&quot;False&quot;. IIF([country]=&quot;USA&quot;,IIF([state]=&quot;CA&quot;,&quot;True&quot;,&quot;False&quot;),&quot;False&quot;)
To implement OR logic, use nested IIF statement chained along the falseValue
path. Example: If country=&quot;USA&quot; or state=&quot;CA&quot;, return value &quot;T rue&quot;, else return
&quot;False&quot;. IIF([country]=&quot;USA&quot;,&quot;True&quot;,IIF([state]=&quot;CA&quot;,&quot;True&quot;,&quot;False&quot;))
If the source attribute used within the IIF function is empty or null, the condition
check fails.
Unsupported IIF expression examples:
IIF([country]=&quot;&quot;,&quot;Other&quot;,[country])
IIF(IsNullOrEmpty([country]),&quot;Other&quot;,[country])
IIF(IsPresent([country]),[country],&quot;Other&quot;)
Recommended workaround: Use the Switch  function to check for empty/null
values. Example: If country attribute is empty, set value &quot;Other&quot;. If it is present,
pass the country attribute value to target attribute.
Switch([country],[country],&quot;&quot;,&quot;Other&quot;)Known limitations

replacementV alue Optional String New value to replace old one with.
replacementA ttribut eName Optional String Name of the attribute to be used for
replacement value
templat e Optional String When templat e value is provided, we&#39;ll look
for oldValue inside the template and replace
it with source value.
Example 1:  Using oldValue and replacementV alue to replace the entire source string
with another string.
Let&#39;s say your HR system has an attribute BusinessTitle. As part of recent job title
changes, your company wants to update anyone with the business title &quot;Product
Developer&quot; to &quot;Software Engineer&quot;. Then in this case, you can use the following
expression in your attribute mapping.
Replace([BusinessTitle],&quot;Product Developer&quot;, , , &quot;Software Engineer&quot;, , )
source: [BusinessTitle]
oldValue: &quot;Product Developer&quot;
replacementV alue: &quot;Software Engineer&quot;
Expression output : Software Engineer
Example 2:  Using oldValue and templat e to insert the source string into another
templatized  string.
The parameter oldValue is a misnomer in this scenario. It&#39;s actually the value that gets
replaced.
Let&#39;s say you want to always generate login ID in the format <username>@contoso.com.
There is a source attribute called UserID  and you want that value to be used for the
<username> portion of the login ID. Then in this case, you can use the following
expression in your attribute mapping.
Replace([UserID],&quot;<username>&quot;, , , , , &quot;<username>@contoso.com&quot;)
source: [UserID] = &quot;jsmith&quot;Replace characters using a regular expression<p>
<p>oldValue:  &quot;<username>&quot;
templat e: &quot;<username>@contoso.com&quot;
Expression output:  &quot;jsmith@contoso.com&quot;
Example 3:  Using regexP attern and replacementV alue to extract a portion of the source
string and replace it with an empty string or a custom value built using regex patterns or
regex group names.
Let&#39;s say you have a source attribute telephoneNumber that has components country
code and phone number separated by a space character. For example, +91 9998887777
Then in this case, you can use the following expression in your attribute mapping to
extract the 10 digit phone number.
Replace([telephoneNumber], , &quot;\+(?<isdcode>\d* )(?<phonenumber>\d{10})&quot;, ,
&quot;${phoneNumber}&quot;, , )
source: [telephoneNumber] = &quot;+91 9998887777&quot;
regexP attern: &quot;\+(?<isdcode>\d* )(?<phonenumber>\d{10})&quot;
replacementV alue:  &quot;${phoneNumber}&quot;
Expression output:  9998887777
You can also use this pattern to remove characters and collapse a string. For example,
the expression below removes parenthesis, dashes and space characters in the mobile
number string and returns only digits.
Replace([mobile], , &quot;[()\s-]+&quot;, , &quot;&quot;, , )
source: [mobile] = &quot;+1 (999) 888-7777&quot;
regexP attern: &quot;[()\s-]+&quot;
replacementV alue:  &quot;&quot; (empty string)
Expression output:  19998887777
Example 4:  Using regexP attern, regexGr oupName  and replacementV alue to extract a
portion of the source string and replace it with another literal value or empty string.
Let&#39;s say your source system has an attribute AddressLineData with two components
street number and street name. As part of a recent move, let&#39;s say the street number of
the address changed, and you want to update only the street number portion of the
address line. Then in this case, you can use the following expression in your attribute
mapping to extract the street number.
Replace([AddressLineData], ,&quot;(?<streetnumber>^\d*)&quot;,&quot;streetNumber&quot;, &quot;888&quot;, , )
source: [AddressLineData] = &quot;545 T remont S treet&quot;<p>
<p>regexP attern: &quot;(?<streetnumber>^\d<em>)&quot;
regexGr oupName:  &quot;streetNumber&quot;
replacementV alue:  &quot;888&quot;
Expression output:  888 T remont S treet
Here is another example where the domain suffix from a UPN is replaced with an empty
string to generate login ID without domain suffix.
Replace([userPrincipalName], , &quot;(?<suffix>@(.)</suffix></em>)&quot;, &quot;Suffix&quot;, &quot;&quot;, , )
source: [userPrincipalName] = &quot;jsmith@contoso.com&quot;
regexP attern: &quot;(?<suffix>@(.)<em>)&quot;
regexGr oupName:  &quot;Suffix&quot;
replacementV alue:  &quot;&quot; (empty string)
Expression output:  jsmith
Example 5:  Using regexP attern, regexGr oupName  and replacementA ttribut eName  to
handle scenarios when the source attribute is empty or doesn&#39;t have a value.
Let&#39;s say your source system has an attribute telephoneNumber. If telephoneNumber is
empty, you want to extract the 10 digits of the mobile number attribute. Then in this
case, you can use the following expression in your attribute mapping.
Replace([telephoneNumber], , &quot;\+(?<isdcode>\d</isdcode></em> )(?<phonenumber>\d{10})&quot;,
&quot;phoneNumber&quot; , , [mobile], )
source: [telephoneNumber] = &quot;&quot; (empty string)
regexP attern: &quot;\+(?<isdcode>\d* )(?<phonenumber>\d{10})&quot;
regexGr oupName:  &quot;phoneNumber&quot;
replacementA ttribut eName:  [mobile] = &quot;+91 8887779999&quot;
Expression output:  8887779999
Example 6:  You need to find characters that match a regular expression value and
remove them.
Replace([mailNickname], , &quot;[a-zA-Z_]*&quot;, , &quot;&quot;, , )

<p>Function:  SelectUniqueV alue(uniqueV alueRule1, uniqueV alueRule2, uniqueV alueRule3,
…)
Description:  Requires a minimum of two arguments, which are unique value generation
rules defined using expressions. The function evaluates each rule and then checks the
value generated for uniqueness in the target app/directory. The first unique value found
will be the one returned. If all of the values already exist in the target, the entry will get
escrowed, and the reason gets logged in the audit logs. There is no upper bound to the
number of arguments that can be provided.
This function must be at the top-level and cannot be nested.
This function cannot be applied to attributes that have a matching precedence.
This function is only meant to be used for entry creations. When using it with an
attribute, set the Apply Mapping  property to Only during object cr eation .
This function is currently only supported for &quot;W orkday to Active Directory User
Provisioning&quot; and &quot;SuccessF actors to Active Directory User Provisioning&quot;. It cannot
be used with other provisioning applications.
The LD AP search that SelectUniqueV alue function performs in on-premises Active
Directory doesn&#39;t escape special characters like diacritics. If you pass a string like
&quot;Jéssica Smith&quot; that contains a special character, you will encounter processing
errors. Nest the NormalizeDiacritics  function as shown in the example below to
normalize special characters.

<p>Function:  Switch(source, defaultV alue, key1, value1, key2, value2, …)
Description:  When source value matches a key, returns value for that key. If source
value doesn&#39;t match any keys, returns defaultV alue. Key and value parameters must
always come in pairs. The function always expects an even number of parameters. The
function shouldn&#39;t be used for referential attributes such as manager.

defaultV alue Optional String Default value to be used when source doesn&#39;t match
any keys. Can be empty string (&quot;&quot;).
key Required String Key to compare source value with.
value Required String Replacement value for the source matching the key.Switch
７ Note
Switch function performs a case-sensitive string comparison of the source and key
values. If you&#39;d like to perform a case-insensitive comparison, normalize the source
string before comparison using a nested T oLower function and ensure that all key
strings use lowercase. Example: Switch(ToLower([statusFlag]), &quot;0&quot;, &quot;true&quot;, &quot;1&quot;,
&quot;false&quot;, &quot;0&quot;). In this example, the source attribute statusFlag may have values
(&quot;True&quot; / &quot;true&quot; / &quot;TRUE&quot;). However, the S witch function will always convert it to
lowercase string &quot;true&quot; before comparison with key parameters.
Ｕ Caution
For the source parameter, do not use the nested functions IsPresent, IsNull or
IsNullOrEmpty. Instead use a literal empty string as one of the key values.
Example: Switch([statusFlag], &quot;Default Value&quot;, &quot;true&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;0&quot;). In this
example, if the source attribute statusFlag is empty, the S witch function will return
the value 0.
