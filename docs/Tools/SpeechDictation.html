<p><img src="../Images/FromDallE/voicedictation.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="windows-speech-recognition">Windows Speech Recognition</h2>
<p>I began my journey by exploring Windows Speech Recognition, one of the oldest AI tools available. After going through multiple rounds of training the system, I found that its dictation capabilities had improved significantly. However, its performance out of the box was considerably worse than expected, which led me to search for alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="voice-typing-a-better-alternative">Voice Typing: A Better Alternative</h2>
<p>I eventually switched to Voice Typing, a newer feature that performed much better with minimal training. Although it lacks some functionality compared to Windows Speech Recognition, it perfectly suited my needs and automatically added punctuation. Voice Typing allowed me to easily interact with ChatGPT, which kept up with my conversation history effectively.</p>
<h2 id="bing-copilot-and-chatgpt-comparing-ai-tools">Bing, Copilot, and ChatGPT: Comparing AI Tools</h2>
<p>To thoroughly evaluate AI tools, I used ChatGPT alongside Bing and Copilot, comparing their pros and cons against each other. This comprehensive evaluation was not limited to just these three tools, as I aimed to explore various AI solutions to find the best fit for my needs.</p>
<h2 id="potential-office-application-integration">Potential Office Application Integration</h2>
<p>As someone familiar with building Office applications, I considered creating an add-in that would allow me to select content in a Word document and send it directly to ChatGPT as a prompt. While this could be a fun hobby project for the future, I'm currently focused on several other exciting endeavors, including the creation of a new website to host my content and future articles.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-of-ai-assisted-writing-and-conclusion">The Future of AI-Assisted Writing and Conclusion</h2>
<p>I anticipate that Microsoft's Copilot offerings will soon bridge many of the gaps between AI tools, allowing for more seamless integration and faster document creation. By combining Voice Typing and AI assistants, users will be able to dictate rough drafts without worrying about errors and rely on AI to produce polished, professional content.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the text you are reading was created and formatted into markdown by ChatGPT-4 from a rough transcript that I generated using Voice Typing in Microsoft Word. All of the ideas are mine and a few of the sentences match the transcript exactly. This demonstrates the potential of combining AI tools to streamline workflows and produce high-quality content with ease.</p>
