Title: Implementing a Customizable Weighted Random Selection Algorithm using a Normal Distribution in C# with a Focus on Code Quality, Detailed User Stories, and Comprehensive Triple-Slash Comments

Description: The purpose of this task is to develop a C# class for a weighted random selection algorithm using a normal distribution (bell curve) while ensuring high code quality, including comprehensive triple-slash comments. The class should include a generic method that can process a list of items and return a selected item based on customizable parameters, such as a center percentage for the peak of the bell curve between 0 and 1, a center height for the center of the bell curve between 0 and 0.95, and a scaling factor for adjusting the standard deviation between 0 and 10. Detailed user stories should be created to address the following aspects:

Class and method implementation: Develop user stories that detail the implementation of the class and method for the weighted random selection algorithm.

Input validation: Write user stories that explain the process of validating input parameters to ensure the algorithm functions correctly.

Weight calculation: Create user stories that describe the calculation of weights for each item in the list based on the customizable parameters.

Random number generation and item selection: Develop user stories that cover the generation of random numbers for item selection based on their weights.

Code quality and triple-slash comments: Emphasize user stories that focus on clear comments, proper formatting, appropriate variable names, and comprehensive triple-slash comments for the solution. The triple-slash comments should include expected results, parameter info, and exceptions in detail.

Your task is to come up with detailed user stories that address each of these aspects, ensuring a well-rounded approach to designing the weighted random selection algorithm. Remember to highlight the importance of code quality, triple-slash comments, and user stories that address the needs of developers and end-users alike.
