Article Â· 04/23/2024

This article provides an overview of the multitenant organization scenario and the related capabilities in Microsoft Entra ID.

### What is a tenant?

A tenant is an instance of Microsoft Entra ID in which information about a single organization resides including organizational objects such as users, groups, and devices and also application registrations, such as Microsoft 365 and third-party applications. A tenant also contains access and compliance policies for resources, such as applications registered in the directory. The primary functions served by a tenant include identity authentication as well as resource access management.

From a Microsoft Entra perspective, a tenant forms an identity and access management scope. For example, a tenant administrator makes an application available to some or all the users in the tenant and enforces access policies on that application for users in that tenant. In addition, a tenant contains organizational branding data that drives end-user experiences, such as the organizations email domains and SharePoint URLs used by employees in that organization. From a Microsoft 365 perspective, a tenant forms the default collaboration and licensing boundary. For example, users in Microsoft Teams or Microsoft Outlook can easily find and collaborate with other users in their tenant, but don't have the ability to find or see users in other tenants.

Tenants contain privileged organizational data and are securely isolated from other tenants. In addition, tenants can be configured to have data persisted and processed in a specific region or cloud, which enables organizations to use tenants as a mechanism to meet data residency and handling compliance requirements.

### What is a multitenant organization?

A multitenant organization is an organization that has more than one instance of Microsoft Entra ID. Here are the primary reasons why an organization might have multiple tenants:

- Conglomerates: Organizations with multiple subsidiaries or business units that operate independently.
