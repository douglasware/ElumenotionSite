A multitenant organization is established as a collaboration of equals. Each tenant
administrator stays in control of their tenant and their membership in the multitenant
organization.
Administrators staying in control of their resources is a guiding principle for multitenant
organization collaboration. Cross-tenant access settings are required for each tenant-to-
tenant relationship. T enant administrators explicitly configure, as needed, the following
policies:
Cross-tenant access partner configurations
