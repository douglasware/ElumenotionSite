Owner t enant
You delete a multitenant organization by removing all tenants. The process for removing
the final owner tenant is the same as the process for removing all other member
tenants.
In the final owner tenant, use the Remove-
MgBetaT enantR elationshipMultiT enantOrganizationT enant  command to
remove the tenant. This operation takes a few minutes.
