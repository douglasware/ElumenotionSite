For people search to succeed, while scoped to local tenant boundaries, the entire
collaborating user set must be represented within the scope of each multitenant
organization tenant A, B, and C, in the form of either internal or B2B identities.
Depending on your organization’s needs, the collaborating user set may contain a
subset of collaborating employees, or eventually all employees.
One of the simpler ways to achieve a collaborating user set in each multitenant
organization tenant is for each tenant administrator to define their user contribution
and synchronization them outbound. T enant administrators on the receiving end should
accept the shared users inbound.
Administrator A contributes or shares Annie
Administrator B contributes or shares Bob and Barbara
Administrator C contributes or shares Charles
