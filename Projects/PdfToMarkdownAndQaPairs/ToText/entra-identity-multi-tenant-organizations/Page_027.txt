Yes. Cross-tenant synchronization uses an internal attribute called the
alternativeSecurityIdentifier to uniquely match an internal user in the source tenant
with an external / B2B user in the target tenant. Cross-tenant synchronization can
update existing B2B users, ensuring that each user has only one account.
Cross-tenant synchronization cannot match an internal user in the source tenant
with an internal user in the target tenant (both type member and type guest).
How often does cross-tenant synchronization run?
The sync interval is currently fixed to start at 40-minute intervals. S ync duration
varies based on the number of in-scope users. The initial sync cycle is likely to take
significantly longer than the following incremental sync cycles.
How do I control what is synchronized into the target tenant?
In the source tenant, you can control which users are provisioned with the
configuration or attribute-based filters. Y ou can also control what attributes on the
user object are synchronized. For more information, see Scoping users or groups
to be provisioned with scoping filters .
If a user is removed from the scope of sync in a source tenant, will cross-tenant
synchronization soft delete them in the target?
Yes. If a user is removed from the scope of sync in a source tenant, cross-tenant
synchronization will soft delete them in the target tenant.
What object types can be synchronized?
Microsoft Entra users can be synchronized between tenants. (Groups, devices, and
contacts aren't currently supported.)
What user types can be synchronized?
Internal members can be synchronized from source tenants. Internal guests can't
be synchronized from source tenants.
Users can be synchronized to target tenants as external members (default) or
external guests.Synchronization frequency
