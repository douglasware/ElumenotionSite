What are the Microsoft Entra user
provisioning logs?
Article •01/25/2024
Microsoft Entra ID integrates with several third party services to provision users into
your tenant. If you need to troubleshoot an issue with a provisioned user, you can use
the information captured in the Microsoft Entra provisioning logs to help find a solution.
Two other activity logs are also available to help monitor the health of your tenant:
Sign-ins  – Information about sign-ins and how your resources are used by your
users.
Audit  – Information about changes applied to your tenant such as users and group
management or updates applied to your tenant’s resources.
This article gives you an overview of the user provisioning logs.
The required roles and licenses might vary based on the report. Global Administrator
can access all reports, but we recommend using a role with least privilege access to
align with the Zero T rust guidance .
