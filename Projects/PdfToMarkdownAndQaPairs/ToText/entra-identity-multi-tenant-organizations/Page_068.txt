The following information is a current list of known limitations with the Microsoft Entra
ECMA Connector Host and on-premises application provisioning.
The following applications and directories aren't yet supported.
When a user is managed by Microsoft Entra Connect, the source of authority is on-
premises Active Directory Domain Services. So, user attributes can't be changed in
Microsoft Entra ID. This preview doesn't change the source of authority for users
managed by Microsoft Entra Connect.
Attempting to use Microsoft Entra Connect and the on-premises provisioning to
provision groups or users into Active Directory Domain Services can lead to
creation of a loop, where Microsoft Entra Connect can overwrite a change that was
made by the provisioning service in the cloud. Microsoft is working on a dedicated
capability for group or user writeback. Upvote the UserV oice feedback on this
website  to track the status of the preview. Alternatively, you can use Microsoft
Identity Manager  for user or group writeback from Microsoft Entra ID to Active
Directory.
By using on-premises provisioning, you can take a user already in Microsoft Entra ID and
provision them into a third-party application. You can 't bring a us er int o the dir ectory
from a thir d-party application.  Customers will need to rely on our native HR integrations,
Microsoft Entra Connect, Microsoft Identity Manager, or Microsoft Graph, to bring users
into the directory.Microsoft Azure Government Cloud
