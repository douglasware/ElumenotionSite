source to multiple targets and from multiple sources into a single target. But only
one sync instance can exist between a source and a target.
Cross-tenant synchronization only synchronizes users that are internal to the
home/source tenant, ensuring that you can't end up with a loop where a user is
written back to the same tenant.
Multiple topologies are supported. For more information, see Topologies for cross-
tenant synchronization .
Can I use cross-tenant synchronization across organizations (outside my multitenant
organization)?
For privacy reasons, cross-tenant synchronization is intended for use within an
organization. W e recommend using entitlement management  for inviting B2B
collaboration users across organizations.
Can cross-tenant synchronization be used to migrate users from one tenant to another
tenant?
No. Cross-tenant synchronization isn't a migration tool because the source tenant
is required for synchronized users to authenticate. In addition, tenant migrations
would require migrating user data such as ShareP oint and OneDrive.
Does cross-tenant synchronization resolve any present B2B collaboration  limitations?
Since cross-tenant synchronization is built on existing B2B collaboration
technology, existing limitations apply. Examples include (but aren't limited to):
App or
