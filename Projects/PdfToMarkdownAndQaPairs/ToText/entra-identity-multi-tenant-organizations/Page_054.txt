This supported topology for cross-tenant synchronization  is one of many in Microsoft
Entra ID. T enants can be a source tenant, a target tenant, or both. In the following
sections, learn how cross-tenant synchronization and Microsoft Entra ID Governance
features address several scenarios.
Cross-tenant synchronization in Microsoft Entra ID  automates creating, updating, and
deleting B2B collaboration users.
When organizations create, or provision, a B2B collaboration user in a tenant, user
access depends partly on how the organization provisioned them: Guest or Member
user type. When you select user type, consider the various properties of a Microsoft
Entra B2B collaboration user . The Member user type is suitable if users are part of the
larger multitenant organization and need member-level access to resources in the
organizational tenants. Microsoft T eams requires the Member user type in multitenant
organizations .
By default, cross-tenant synchronization includes commonly used attributes on the user
object in Microsoft Entra ID. The following diagram illustrates this scenario.Manage employee lifecycles across tenants
