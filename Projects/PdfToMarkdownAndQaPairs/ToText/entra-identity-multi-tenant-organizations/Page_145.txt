The on-demand provisioning process attempts to show the steps that the provisioning
service takes when provisioning a user. There are typically five steps to provision a user.
One or more of those steps, explained in the following sections, are shown during the

request for a "test user". The provisioning service expects a response that indicates that
the service authorized to continue with the provisioning steps. This step is shown only
when it fails. It's not shown during the on-demand provisioning experience when the
step is successful.
