By default, Microsoft Entra provisioning connectors don't have any attribute-based
scoping filters configured.
A scoping filter consists of one or more claus es. Clauses determine which users are
allowed to pass through the scoping filter by evaluating each user's attributes. For
example, you might have one clause that requires that a user's "S tate" attribute equals
"New Y ork", so only New Y ork users are provisioned into the application.
A single clause defines a single condition for a single attribute value. If multiple clauses
are created in a single scoping filter, they're evaluated together using "AND" logic. The
"AND" logic means all clauses must evaluate to "true" in order for a user to be
provisioned.
Finally, multiple scoping filters can be created for a single application. If multiple
scoping filters are present, they're evaluated together by using "OR" logic. The "OR"
logic means that if all the clauses in any of the configured scoping filters evaluate to
"true", the user is provisioned.
Each user or group processed by the Microsoft Entra provisioning service is always
evaluated individually against each scoping filter.
As an example, consider the following scoping filter:
According to this scoping filter, users must satisfy the following criteria to be
provisioned:
They must be in New Y ork.Scoping filter construction
