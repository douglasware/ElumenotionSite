The following attributes and objects aren't supported:
Multivalued attributes.
Reference attributes (for example, manager).
Groups.
Complex anchors (for example, ObjectT ypeName+UserName).
Attributes that have characters such as "." or "["
Binary attributes.
On-premises applications are sometimes not federated with Microsoft Entra ID and
require local passwords. The on-premises provisioning preview doesn't support
password synchronization. Provisioning initial one-time passwords is supported.
Ensure that you're using the Redact  function to redact the passwords from the
logs. In the SQL and LD AP connectors, the passwords aren't exported on the initial
call to the application, but rather a second call with set password.
The Microsoft Entra ECMA Connector Host currently requires either an SSL certificate to
be trusted by Azure or the provisioning agent to be used. The certificate subject must
match the host name the Microsoft Entra ECMA Connector Host is installed on.
The Microsoft Entra ECMA Connector Host currently doesn't support anchor attribute
changes (renames) or target systems, which require multiple attributes to form an
anchor.
The attributes that the target application supports are discovered and surfaced in the
Microsoft Entra admin center in Attribut e Mappings . Newly added attributes will
continue to be discovered. If an attribute type has changed, for example, string to
Boolean, and the attribute is part of the mappings, the type won't change automatically
in the Microsoft Entra admin center. Customers will need to go into advanced settings in
mappings and manually update the attribute type.Attributes and objects
