Investigate and reject deletions as necessary:
Investigate the source of the deletions. Y ou can use the provisioning logs for
details.
Prevent the deletion by assigning the user / group to the application (or
configuration) again, restoring the user / group, or updating your provisioning
configuration.
Once you've made the necessary changes to prevent the user / group from being
deleted, restart provisioning. Don't restart provisioning until you've made the
necessary changes to prevent the users / groups from being deleted.
You can test the feature by triggering disable / deletion events by setting the threshold
to a low number, for example 3, and then changing scoping filters, unassigning users,
and deleting users from the directory (see common scenarios in next section).
Let the provisioning job run (20 â€“ 40 mins) and navigate back to the provisioning page.
Check the provisioning job in quarantine and choose to allow the deletions or review
the provisioning logs to understand why the deletions occurred.
