Organizations that own multiple Microsoft Entra tenants and want to streamline
intra-organization cross-tenant application access.
Cross-tenant synchronization is not currently suitable for use across organizational
boundaries.
With cross-tenant synchronization, you can do the following:
Automatically create B2B collaboration users within your organization and provide
them access to the applications they need, without creating and maintaining
custom scripts.
Improve the user experience and ensure that users can access resources, without
receiving an invitation email and having to accept a consent prompt in each
tenant.
Automatically update users and remove them when they leave the organization.
Users created by cross-tenant synchronization will have the same experience when
accessing Microsoft T eams and other Microsoft 365 services as B2B collaboration users
created through a manual invitation. If your organization uses shared channels, please
see the known issues  document for additional details. Over time, the member userT ype
will be used by the various Microsoft 365 services to provide differentiated end user
experiences for users in a multitenant organization.
