minutes between when an object is assigned to an application and when that
assignment is honored in on-demand provisioning. Y ou may need to wait a few
minutes and try again.
Do y ou need t o turn pr ovisioning o ff to use on-demand pr ovisioning?  For
applications that use a long-lived bearer token or a user name and password for
authorization, no more steps are required. Applications that use O Auth for
authorization currently require the provisioning job to be stopped before using
on-demand provisioning. Applications such as G Suite, Box, W orkplace by
Facebook, and Slack fall into this category. W ork is in progress to support on-
demand provisioning for all applications without having to stop provisioning jobs.
How long does on-demand pr ovisioning tak e? On-demand provisioning typically
takes less than 30 seconds.
There are currently a few known limitations to on-demand provisioning. P ost your
suggestions and feedback  so we can better determine what improvements to make
next.
On-demand provisioning of groups supports updating up to five members at a
time. Connectors for cross-tenant synchronization, W orkday, etc. do not support
group provisioning and as a result do not support on-demand provisioning of
groups.
On-demand provisioning supports provisioning one user at a time through the
Microsoft Entra admin center.
Restoring a previously soft-deleted user in the target tenant with on-demand
provisioning isn't supported. If you try to soft-delete a user with on-demand
provisioning and then restore the user, it can result in duplicate users.
On-demand provisioning of roles isn't supported.Frequently asked questions
