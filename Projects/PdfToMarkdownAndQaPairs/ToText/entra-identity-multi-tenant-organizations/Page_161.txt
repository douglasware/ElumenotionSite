Reference for writing expressions for
attribute ma ppings in Microsoft Entra ID
Article â€¢01/26/2024
When you configure provisioning to a SaaS application, one of the types of attribute
mappings that you can specify is an expression mapping. For these mappings, you must
write a script-like expression that allows you to transform your users' data into formats
that are more acceptable for the SaaS application.
The syntax for Expressions for Attribute Mappings is reminiscent of Visual Basic for
Applications (VBA) functions.
The entire expression must be defined in terms of functions, which consist of a
name followed by arguments in parentheses: FunctionName( <<argument 1>>,
<<argument N>>)
You can nest functions within each other. For example:
FunctionOne(FunctionT wo(<<argument1>>))
You can pass three different types of arguments into functions:
1. Attributes, which must be enclosed in square brackets. For example:
[attributeName]
2. String constants, which must be enclosed in double quotes. For example:
"United S tates"
3. Other Functions. For example: FunctionOne( <<argument1>>,
FunctionT wo(<<argument2>>))
For string constants, if you need a backslash ( \ ) or quotation mark ( " ) in the
string, it must be escaped with the backslash ( \ ) symbol. For example: "Company
name: \"Contoso\""
The syntax is case-sensitive, which must be considered while typing them as strings
in a function vs copy pasting them directly from here.Syntax overview
