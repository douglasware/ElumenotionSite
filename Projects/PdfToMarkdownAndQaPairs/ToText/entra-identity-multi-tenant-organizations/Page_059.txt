You can use entitlement management and cross-tenant access policies to control access
to resources across tenants. Entitlement management will assign the right users to the
right resources, while cross-tenant access policies and conditional access together
perform the necessary run-time checks to ensure the right users are accessing the right
resources.
Entitlement management
Assigning Microsoft Entra roles through entitlement management access packages
helps to efficiently manage role assignments at scale and improves the role assignment
lifecycle. It provides a flexible request and approval process for gaining access to
directory roles, app roles, and groups while also enabling automatic assignment to
resources based on user attributes.ﾉExpand table
