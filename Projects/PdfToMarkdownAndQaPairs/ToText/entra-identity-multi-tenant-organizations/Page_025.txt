Cross-tenant synchronization provides a flexible solution to enable collaboration, but
every organization is different. For example, you might have a central tenant, satellite
tenants, or sort of a mesh of tenants. Cross-tenant synchronization supports any of
these topologies. For more information, see Topologies for cross-tenant
synchronization .
In the target tenant where users are created, navigate to the Cross-t enant access
settings  page. Here you enable cross-tenant synchronization and the B2B automatic
redemption settings by selecting the respective check boxes. For more information, see
Configure cross-tenant synchronization .
In any source tenant, navigate to the Cross-t enant access settings  page and enable the
B2B automatic redemption feature. Next, you use the Cross-t enant synchr onization
page to set up a cross-tenant synchronization job and specify:
Which users you want to synchronize
What attributes you want to include
Any transformations
