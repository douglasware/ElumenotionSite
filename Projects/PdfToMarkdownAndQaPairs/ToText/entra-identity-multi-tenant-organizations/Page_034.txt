Multitenant organization identity
provisioning for Microsoft 365
Article â€¢04/24/2024
The multitenant organization capability is designed for organizations that own multiple
Microsoft Entra tenants and want to streamline intra-organization cross-tenant
collaboration in Microsoft 365. It's built on the premise of reciprocal provisioning of B2B
member users across multitenant organization tenants.
Teams external access  and Teams shared channels  excluded, Microsoft 365 people
search  is typically scoped to within local tenant boundaries. In multitenant organizations
with increased need for cross-tenant coworker collaboration, it's recommended to
reciprocally provision users from their home tenants into the resource tenants of
collaborating coworkers.
The new Microsoft T eams  experience improves upon Microsoft 365 people search and
Teams external access for a unified seamless collaboration experience. For this improved
experience to light up, the multitenant organization representation in Microsoft Entra ID
is required and collaborating users shall be provisioned as B2B members. For more
information, see Announcing more seamless collaboration in Microsoft T eams for
multitenant organizations .
Collaboration in Microsoft 365 is built on the premise of reciprocal provisioning of B2B
identities across multitenant organization tenants.
For example, say Annie in tenant A, Bob and Barbara in tenant B, and Charlie in tenant C
want to collaborate. Conceptually, these four users represent a collaborating user set of
four internal identities across three tenants.Microsoft 365 people search
