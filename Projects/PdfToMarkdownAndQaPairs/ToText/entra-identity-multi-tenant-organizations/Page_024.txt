To configure this setting using Microsoft Graph, see the Update
crossT enantAccessP olicyConfigurationP artner  API. For more information, see Configure
cross-tenant synchronization .
For cross-tenant synchronization, users don't receive an email or have to accept a
consent prompt. If users want to see what tenants they belong to, they can open their
My Account  page and select Organizations . In the Microsoft Entra admin center, users
can open their Portal settings , view their Directories + subscriptions , and switch
directories.
For more information, including privacy information, see Leave an organization as an
external user .
