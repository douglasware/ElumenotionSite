The View details  section shows the scoping conditions that were evaluated. Y ou might
see one or more of the following properties:
Activ e in sour ce syst em indicates that the user has the property IsActive set to
true in Microsoft Entra ID.
Assigned t o application  indicates that the user is assigned to the application in
Microsoft Entra ID.
Scope sync all  indicates that the scope setting allows all users and groups in the
tenant.
User has r equir ed role indicates that the user has the necessary roles to be
provisioned into the application.
Scoping filt ers are also shown if you have defined scoping filters for your
application. The filter is displayed with the following format: {scoping filter title}
{scoping filter attribute} {scoping filter operator} {scoping filter value}.
Make sure that you've defined a valid scoping role. For example, avoid using the
Greater_Than operator  with a noninteger value.
If the user doesn't have the necessary role, review the tips for provisioning users
assigned to the default access role .
In this step, the service attempts to match the user that was retrieved in the import step
with a user in the target system.
The View details  page shows the properties of the users that were matched in the target
system. The context pane changes as follows:
If no users are matched in the target system, no properties are shown.
If one user matches in the target system, the properties of that user are shown.
If multiple users match, the properties of both users are shown.
If multiple matching attributes are part of your attribute mappings, each matching
attribute is evaluated sequentially and the matched users for that attribute are
shown.Troubleshooting tips
