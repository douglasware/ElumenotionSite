organization.
For license information, see License requirements .
Security Administrator  role to configure cross-tenant access settings and templates
for the multitenant organization.
Global Administrator  role to consent to required permissions.
The cross-tenant access partner configuration  handles trust settings and automatic user
consent settings between partner tenants. For example, you can use these settings to
trust multifactor authentication claims for inbound users from the target partner tenant.
With the template in an unconfigured state, partner configurations for partner tenants in
the multitenant organization won't be amended, with all trust settings passed through
from default settings. However, if you configure the template, then partner
configurations will be amended corresponding to the policy template.
To specify which trust settings and automatic user consent settings to apply to your
policy template, use the Update multiT enantOrganizationP artnerConfigurationT emplate
API. If you create or join a multitenant organization using the Microsoft 365 admin
center, this configuration is handled automatically.
