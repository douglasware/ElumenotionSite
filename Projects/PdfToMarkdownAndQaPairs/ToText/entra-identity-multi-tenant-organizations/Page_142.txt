configuration).
To learn more about deprovisioning scenarios, see How Application Provisioning W orks.
When a user is set for removal from the target application (or target tenant), it's counted
against the deletion threshold. Scenarios that could lead to a user being removed from
the target application (or target tenant) could include: unassigning the user from the
application (or configuration) and soft / hard deleting a user in the directory. Groups
evaluated for deletion count towards the deletion threshold. In addition to deletions, the
same functionality also works for disables.
It's evaluated each cycle. If the number of deletions doesn't exceed the threshold during
a single cycle, the “circuit breaker” isn't triggered. If multiple cycles are needed to reach
a steady state, the deletion threshold is evaluated per cycle.
You can find users that should be disabled / deleted but haven’t due to the deletion
threshold. Navigation to Provisioning logs  and then filter Action  with StagedAction  or
StagedDelet e.
