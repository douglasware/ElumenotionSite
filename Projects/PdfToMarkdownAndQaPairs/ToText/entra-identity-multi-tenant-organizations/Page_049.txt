While some companies centralize their users within a single tenant, others have a more
decentralized structure with applications, HR systems, and Active Directory domains
integrated into each tenant. Cross-tenant synchronization offers the flexibility to choose
which users are provisioned into each tenant.
In this scenario, each tenant represents a different company within the same parent
organization. Administrators in each tenant choose a subset of users to provision into
the target tenant. This solution provides flexibility for each tenant to operate
independently, while facilitating collaboration when users need access to critical
resources.Mesh
