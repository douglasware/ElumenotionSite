Function:  SingleAppR oleAssignment([appR oleAssignments])
Description:  Returns a single appR oleAssignment from the list of all
appR oleAssignments assigned to a user for a given application. This function is required
to convert the appR oleAssignments object into a single role name string. The best
practice is to ensure only one appR oleAssignment is assigned to one user at a time. This
function isn't supported in scenarios where users have multiple app role assignments.
