Provide product feedback  |Get help at Microsoft Q&AOn-demand provisioning supports disabling users that have been unassigned from
the application. However, it doesn't support disabling or deleting users that have
been disabled or deleted from Microsoft Entra ID. Those users don't appear when
you search for a user.
On-demand provisioning doesn't support nested groups that aren't directly
assigned to the application.
The on-demand provisioning request API can only accept a single group with up to
5 members at a time.
