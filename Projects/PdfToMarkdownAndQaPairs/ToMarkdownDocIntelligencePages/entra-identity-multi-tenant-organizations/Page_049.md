# Mesh

While some companies centralize their users within a single tenant, others have a more decentralized structure with applications, HR systems, and Active Directory domains integrated into each tenant. Cross-tenant synchronization offers the flexibility to choose which users are provisioned into each tenant.


# Collaborate within a portfolio company (partial-mesh)

In this scenario, each tenant represents a different company within the same parent organization. Administrators in each tenant choose a subset of users to provision into the target tenant. This solution provides flexibility for each tenant to operate independently, while facilitating collaboration when users need access to critical resources.
