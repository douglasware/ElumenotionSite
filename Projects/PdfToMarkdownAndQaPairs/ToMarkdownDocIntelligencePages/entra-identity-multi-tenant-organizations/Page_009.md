| Trust level | Mid trust. B2B direct connect users are less easy to track, mandating a certain level of trust with the external organization. | Low to mid trust. User objects can be tracked easily and managed with granular controls. | High trust. All tenants are part of the same organization, and users are typically granted member access to all apps/resources. | High trust.

| Effect on users | Users access the resource tenant using the credentials for their home tenant. User objects aren't created in the resource tenant. | External users are added to a tenant as B2B collaboration users. | Within the same organization, users are synchronized from their home tenant to the resource tenant as B2B collaboration users. | Within the same multitenant organization, B2B collaboration users, particularly member users, benefit from enhanced, seamless collaboration across Microsoft 365. |
