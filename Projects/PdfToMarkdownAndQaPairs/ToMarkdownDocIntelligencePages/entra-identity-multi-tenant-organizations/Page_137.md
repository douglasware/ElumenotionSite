c. ENDS\_WITH. Clause returns "true" if the evaluated attribute ends with the input string value.

d. EQUALS. Clause returns "true" if the evaluated attribute matches the input string value exactly (case sensitive).

e. Greater Than. Clause returns "true" if the evaluated attribute is greater than the value. The value specified on the scoping filter must be an integer and the attribute on the user must be an integer [0,1,2, ... ].

f. Greater\_Than\_OR\_EQUALS. Clause returns "true" if the evaluated attribute is greater than or equal to the value. The value specified on the scoping filter must be an integer and the attribute on the user must be an integer [0,1,2, ... ].

g. Includes. Clause returns "true" if the evaluated attribute contains the string value (case sensitive) as described here.

h. IS FALSE. Clause returns "true" if the evaluated attribute contains a Boolean value of false.

i. IS NOT NULL. Clause returns "true" if the evaluated attribute isn't empty.

j. IS NULL. Clause returns "true" if the evaluated attribute is empty.

k. IS TRUE. Clause returns "true" if the evaluated attribute contains a Boolean value of true.

I. NOT EQUALS. Clause returns "true" if the evaluated attribute doesn't match the input string value (case sensitive).

m. NOT REGEX MATCH. Clause returns "true" if the evaluated attribute doesn't match a regular expression pattern. It returns "false" if the attribute is null / empty.
