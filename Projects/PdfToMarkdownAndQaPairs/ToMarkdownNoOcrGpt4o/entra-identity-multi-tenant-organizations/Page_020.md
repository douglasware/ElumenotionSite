## Who should use?

- Organizations that own multiple Microsoft Entra tenants and want to streamline intra-organization cross-tenant application access.
- Cross-tenant synchronization is not currently suitable for use across organizational boundaries.

## Benefits

With cross-tenant synchronization, you can do the following:

- Automatically create B2B collaboration users within your organization and provide them access to the applications they need, without creating and maintaining custom scripts.
- Improve the user experience and ensure that users can access resources, without receiving an invitation email and having to accept a consent prompt in each tenant.
- Automatically update users and remove them when they leave the organization.

## Teams and Microsoft 365

Users created by cross-tenant synchronization will have the same experience when accessing Microsoft Teams and other Microsoft 365 services as B2B collaboration users created through a manual invitation. If your organization uses shared channels, please see the known issues document for additional details. Over time, the `member` userType will be used by the various Microsoft 365 services to provide differentiated end user experiences for users in a multitenant organization.
