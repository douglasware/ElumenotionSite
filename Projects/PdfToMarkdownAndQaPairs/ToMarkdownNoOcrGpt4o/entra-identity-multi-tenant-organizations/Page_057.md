## Review target-tenant user access

Organizations can include B2B collaboration users in access reviews, including users provisioned by cross-tenant synchronization in target tenants. This option enables access recertification of resources in target tenants. Although organizations can target all users in access reviews, guest users can be explicitly targeted if necessary.

For organizations that synchronize B2B collaboration users, typically Microsoft doesnâ€™t recommend removing denied guest users automatically from access reviews. Cross-tenant synchronization reprovisions the users if they're in the synchronization scope.
