## Why use cross-tenant synchronization?

Cross-tenant synchronization automates creating, updating, and deleting B2B collaboration users. Users created with cross-tenant synchronization are able to access both Microsoft applications (such as Teams and SharePoint) and non-Microsoft applications (such as [ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/), [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/), and many more), regardless of which tenant the apps are integrated with. These users continue to benefit from the security capabilities in Microsoft Entra ID, such as [Microsoft Entra Conditional Access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/) and [cross-tenant access settings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/cross-tenant-access-settings), and can be governed through features such as [Microsoft Entra entitlement management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/governance/entitlement-management-overview).

The following diagram shows how you can use cross-tenant synchronization to enable users to access applications across tenants in your organization.
