## Sharing your users

One of the simpler ways to achieve a collaborating user set in each multitenant organization tenant is for each tenant administrator to define their user contribution and synchronization them outbound. Tenant administrators on the receiving end should accept the shared users inbound.

- Administrator A contributes or shares Annie
- Administrator B contributes or shares Bob and Barbara
- Administrator C contributes or shares Charles
