## Purpose

| B2B direct connect (Org-to-org external or internal) | B2B collaboration (Org-to-org external or internal) | Cross-tenant synchronization (Org internal) | Multitenant organization (Org internal) |

Depending on automatic redemption settings, users might need to accept a consent prompt in each tenant. | Users can seamlessly access apps/resources across the same organization, even if they’re hosted in different tenants. | Users can more seamlessly collaborate across a multitenant organization in new Teams and people search. |

## Value
