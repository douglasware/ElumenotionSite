### Authorization

#### Unable to change provisioning mode back to manual

After you've configured provisioning for the first time, you'll notice that the provisioning mode has switched from manual to automatic. You can't change it back to manual. But you can turn off provisioning through the UI. Turning off provisioning in the UI effectively does the same as setting the dropdown to manual.

### Attribute mappings

#### Attribute SamAccountName or userType not available as a source attribute

The attributes **SamAccountName** and **userType** aren't available as a source attribute by default. Extend your schema to add the attributes. You can add the attributes to the list of available source attributes by extending your schema. To learn more, see [Missing source attribute](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/missing-source-attribute).

#### Source attribute dropdown missing for schema extension

Extensions to your schema can sometimes be missing from the source attribute dropdown in the UI. Go into the advanced settings of your attribute mappings and extend your schema to add the necessary attributes.
