A multitenant organization is established as a collaboration of equals. Each tenant administrator stays in control of their tenant and their membership in the multitenant organization.

## Cross-tenant access settings

Administrators staying in control of their resources is a guiding principle for multitenant organization collaboration. Cross-tenant access settings are required for each tenant-to-tenant relationship. Tenant administrators explicitly configure, as needed, the following policies:

- Cross-tenant access partner configurations

  For more information, see Configure cross-tenant access settings for B2B collaboration and crossTenantAccessPolicyConfigurationPartner resource type.

- Cross-tenant access identity synchronization

  For more information, see Configure cross-tenant synchronization and crossTenantIdentitySyncPolicyPartner resource type.
