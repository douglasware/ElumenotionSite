# How does a multitenant organization work?

The multitenant organization capability enables you to form a tenant group within your organization. The following list describes the basic lifecycle of a multitenant organization.

· Define a multitenant organization

One tenant administrator defines a multitenant organization as a grouping of tenants. The grouping of tenants isn't reciprocal until each listed tenant takes action to join the multitenant organization. The objective is a reciprocal agreement between all listed tenants.

· Join a multitenant organization

Tenant administrators of listed tenants take action to join the multitenant organization. After joining, the multitenant organization relationship is reciprocal between each and every tenant that joined the multitenant organization.

· Leave a multitenant organization

Tenant administrators of listed tenants can leave a multitenant organization at any time. While a tenant administrator who defined the multitenant organization can add and remove listed tenants they don't control the other tenants.
