This article describes the key steps to configure a multitenant organization using Microsoft Graph PowerShell or Microsoft Graph API. This article uses an example owner tenant named **Cairo** and two member tenants named **Berlin** and **Athens**.

If you instead want to use the Microsoft 365 admin center to configure a multitenant organization, see [Set up a multitenant org in Microsoft 365](https://example.com/set-up-multi-tenant-org) and [Join or leave a multitenant organization in Microsoft 365](https://example.com/join-leave-multi-tenant-org). To learn how to configure Microsoft Teams for your multitenant organization, see [The new Microsoft Teams desktop client](https://example.com/new-teams-client).
