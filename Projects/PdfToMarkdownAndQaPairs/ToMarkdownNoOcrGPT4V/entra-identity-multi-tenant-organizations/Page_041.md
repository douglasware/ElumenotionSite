## Interpretation of Template Property Values

Finally, in terms of interpretation of template property values, any template property value of `null` has no effect on the corresponding property value in the targeted cross-tenant access settings, while a defined template property value causes the corresponding property value in the targeted cross-tenant access settings to be amended in accordance with the template. The following table illustrates how template property values are being applied to corresponding cross-tenant access setting values.

| Template Value   | Initial Partner Settings Value (Before joining multitenant org) | Final Partner Settings Value (After joining multitenant org) |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| null             | `<Partner Settings Value>`                                     | `<Partner Settings Value>`                                 |
| `<Template Value>` | `<any value>`                                                    | `<Template Value>`                                         |

## Policy Templates used by Microsoft 365 Admin Center

When a multitenant organization is formed in Microsoft 365 admin center, an administrator agrees to the following multitenant organization template settings:
- Identity synchronization is set to allow users to synchronize into this tenant
- Cross-tenant access is set to automatically redeem user invitations for both inbound and outbound

This is achieved by setting the corresponding three template property values to `true`:
- `automaticUserConsentSettings.inboundAllowed`
- `automaticUserConsentSettings.outboundAllowed`
- `userSyncInbound`

For more information, see [Join or leave a multitenant organization in Microsoft 365](#).

## Cross-tenant Access Settings at Time of Multitenant Organization Disassembly

Currently, there's no equivalent policy template feature supporting the disassembly of a multitenant organization. When a partner tenant leaves the multitenant organization, each tenant administrator must re-examine and amend accordingly the cross-tenant access settings for the partner tenant that left the multitenant organization.
