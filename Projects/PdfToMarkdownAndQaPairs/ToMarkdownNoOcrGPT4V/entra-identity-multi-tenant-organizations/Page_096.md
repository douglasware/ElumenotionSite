### Screenshot Description:
The screenshot displays the interface for assigning users and groups to an application. Under "Fabrikam to Contoso | Users and groups", various options like Overview, Provisioning, and Users and groups are visible. A user interface element allows the addition of a user/group, editing assignment, and removal. The application visibility setting can be toggled to be not visible in "My Apps". Below, a sub-panel lists users and groups with columns for Display Name, Object Type, and Role assigned, along with checkboxes to select the entities.
